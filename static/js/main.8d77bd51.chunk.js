When Apple began its rise to world dominance, I was still too young to be a heavy computer user.

UI and UX are often grouped together as UI/UX, and it wasn\u2019t until recently that I started thinking about their differences. UI stands for User Interface, and I think this is what most people think about when they imagine a designer. UI includes aspects such as color, layout, and aesthetics. UX stands for User Experience, and may have very little to do with visual design, but rather with how a human interacts with an object. UX involves thinking about how a designer can help make using a device as intuitive as possible. UI and UX can be completely independent of each other. Imagine you download an app with great UI: the colors are beautiful, there are tons of animations when you interact with the screen, etc. Now imagine that you start interacting with the app. You want to move an object from the bottom to the top of the screen. Instinctively, you click and drag. Nothing happens. Finally, you realize if you tap on the object, a menu appears. In that menu,  hidden at the bottom of a scrollable list of 20 options, you finally see \u201cMove\u201d. You tap \u201cMove\u201d, and are taken to a new screen where you are asked to enter X and Y coordinates for the desired location of the object. Talk about bad UX.
