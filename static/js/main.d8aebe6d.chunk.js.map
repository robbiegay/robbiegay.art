weekend, I wanted to explore \n                            Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit\">SpriteKit</a>, and \n                            maybe dip my toes into game design. I followed \n                            a <a href=\"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/36/\">tutorial</a> from \n                            Hacking with Swift, and found that SpriteKit made the physics and world \n                            building aspect of game development really simple! After following the \n                            tutorial and building the \"Crashy Plane\" game (a clone \n                            of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird\">Flappy Bird</a>), I \n                            wanted to try building my own game. I built a simple platform game, \n                            where a user attempts to dodge oncoming \n                            obstacles and make it to the end of the level (the game turned out suspiciously \n                            like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Game\">another game</a> that \n                            I enjoyed in the early 2010's). I had a lot of fun building this, \n                            particularly because it gave me an excuse to play around with \n                            making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art\">pixel art</a>, and \n                            an opportunity to do some custom sound design work. Feel free to check \n                            out the Beta version of the app! Despite naming it \"The Easy Game\", I \n                            find the current build fairly hard to beat...\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">May 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Glch Photo App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Swift, Core Image Framework</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/1ZTQ3ZSX\">App Beta</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.robbiegay.art/apps/glch\">App Info Page</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            Glch is a glitch/distorted photo generator. The user opens the app and \n                            is presented with a custom camera controller. There are no parameters for the \n                            user to adjust. Rather, when the user takes a photo, one of 14 photo distortion \n                            effects is randomly applied. The user then has the option to save the photo or discard it \n                            and try again. I wanted the UX to be optimized for quick experimentation by taking new photos. All buttons are therefore situated on the bottom of the screen, allowing \n                            for rapid, single-handed use. As mentioned above, the current iteration has 14 filters. It \n                            is my goal to continue to add filters (likely until I have 25-50 total), and then publish to the \n                            app store.

This is a pretty standard website, built using React.js and Bootstrap, \n                            although I did find a \n                            cool <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-animation\" title=\"React Typing Animation\">typing animation</a> package \n                            to add simple animation to the splash page.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">April 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Instagram Clone iOS App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Swift, Firebase, AVFoundation, PhotoKit</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsI42rxDQs\">Video Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/learning-swift/tree/master/instagram-firebase-clone\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            In order to better understand Swift and mobile app development, I created a clone of \n                            the Instagram app, with backend data being stored on Firebase. Similar to the actual \n                            Instagram app, there is a Home feed where users can scroll through and view posts from \n                            users that they follow. In this feed, users can like, unlike and comment on posts. There is \n                            also a Capture Photo button that utilizes \n                            the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation\" title=\"AVFoundation Documentation Page\">AVFoundation framework</a> to \n                            build a custom camera interface to capture and save new photos. The Search page allows users to search for \n                            and follow and unfollow users. The Home feed has a drag-to-update feature to reflect changes in \n                            users that they follow. The Photo Selector controller utilizes \n                            the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit\" title=\"PhotoKit Documentation Page\">PhotoKit SDK</a> to \n                            create a page for selecting photos from your camera roll. The selected photo can then be \n                            shared to your profile. Finally, users can visit their Profile page where they can view \n                            the number of posts they have shared, users that they follow, and users that follow \n                            them. Users can toggle between viewing their posts in a grid or list view. Users can \n                            logout from their Profile page. When no one is logged into the app, users are \n                            prompted to login or create a profile.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">April 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Moolathon App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Swift, Firebase, Google Maps SDK</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moolathon/id1486017163\">Apple App Store Link (iPhone Only Link)</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"http://moolathon.com/\">Moolathon Website</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            In the Spring of 2020, I worked as a part of a team developing an app called Moolathon. \n                            Moolathon is a fitness fundraising app, where users raise money by running more miles. \n                            I helped create a feature where users could turn a workout summary into an easily shareable \n                            post for social media. Moolathon was released on the Apple App store in March of 2020.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">March 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Robbiegay.art</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title className=\"text-left\">Bootstrap, React.js, React Router, Pts.js</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.robbiegay.art/\">Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/robbiegay.art\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            In late February, I decided it was finally time to upgrade my website. \n                            I built <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/\">my old website</a> early on in \n                            the Bootcamp, and since I have learned several new frameworks and libraries since then, \n                            I thought it would be best to rebuild from the ground up. This iteration of my website is built \n                            using Bootstrap and React.js for the front end. The page navigation is run through \n                            React Router. For the homepage, I wanted to do something that both showcased some technical \n                            skill in Web Developer, as well as something creative from my background \n                            in the arts. I created a homepage that animates through a range of \"sunrise-ey\" colors, and which \n                            increases in luminosity as the user moves their mouse vertically from the bottom to the \n                            top of the page.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">February 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Calculator iOS App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title className=\"text-left\">Swift, Xcode, UIKit, TinyConstraints</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koZmsJvPW5k\">Video Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/learning-swift/tree/master/calculator-app\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            To help learn basic iOS app development, I wanted to create a iOS version of a web based \n                            app I had previously completed. During the Awesome Inc Bootcamp, I built \n                            a <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/calculator/\" title=\"Live demo of my JS Calculator\">calculator app</a> using \n                            JavaScript.

I used \n                            Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit\" title=\"UIKit Documentation Page\">UIKit framework</a> to \n                            build the various buttons and displays and used Robert-Hein \n                            Hooijmans's <a href=\"https://github.com/roberthein/TinyConstraints\">TinyConstraints</a> as \n                            syntactic sugar for Auto Layout.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">February 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Phone Simulator</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>React.js and Hooks</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/phone-sim/\">Demo</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/phone-sim\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                            For the Phone Simulator, I combined 6 projects that we worked on during\n                            the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. The Phone Simulator displays the\n                            current time at the top of the \"screen\". Below that, there is a weather\n                            module that pulls realtime weather data based on your current location.\n                            Below the weather app is a countdown timer (currently set to countdown\n                            to my birthday — March 21st).

The most challenging\n                            aspect was dealing with various \"edge-case\" scenarios. The calculator would\n                            work pretty well if users performed a basic math function (ex. 5 + 3), then \n                            cleared the memory (\"C\" button), and then performed another basic math \n                            function. A real world user, however, would likely use the calculator in \n                            many different ways. There were a multitude of orders in which the user \n                            might press various buttons. Additionally, there had to be ways of dealing with\n                            inputs that didn't make much sense at all (ex. What would happen if the\n                            user inputted: + - 53 + / 4 - 4?). And the final (and perhaps most difficult)\n                            part of dealing with edge-cases was getting to a point where you had several \n                            fixes for very specific situations, and then had to try to not break any of \n                            those old fixes whenever you implemented a fix for a new scenario.                       \n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">October 2019</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Tic-Tac-Toe</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>HTML and JavaScript</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/tic-tac-toe/\">Demo</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/tic-tac-toe\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                            Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two users to play against each\n                            other.

I took a 1-credit\n                    \"Digital Music Production\" course, and with the help of my professor, Dr. Dan Worley,\n                    made a remix of an XX song.

I moved in with my parents, worked several part-time jobs, and spent most\n                    of my time making music. During the next 3 years, I made lot of music while also reviving some old passions in\n                    filmmaking (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/robbiegay\" title=\"filmmaking portfolio\">filmmaking portfolio</a>) and\n                    photography (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robbiegay/\" title=\"photography portfolio\">photography portfolio</a>).\n                </p>\n                <iframe title=\"NITRO (robbiegay remix)\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/869678896&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" />\n                \n                <br /><br />\n                <p>\n                    After 3 years of working in the arts, I decided that I wanted to pursue a day job that was\n                    both interesting and financially in-demand. I was really fortunate to hear\n                    about Awesome Inc's  <a href=\"https://www.awesomeinc.org/bootcamp\" title=\"Bootcamp Website\">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>, and\n                    I spent the Fall of 2019 completing that course. During this time, I took a break from making music.\n                    I had become burnt out on trying to make a living making music. During the Spring of 2020, I began to slowly\n                    get back into making music, but this time with a focus on exploring ideas that interested me and having fun.\n                </p>\n                <iframe title=\"pitter_patter\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/929164231&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" />\n\n                <br /><br /><br /><br />\n                <Container>\n                    <Row>\n                        <Col xs={3}></Col>\n                        <Col xs={6}>\n                            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                                <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3qNg01UJiLcqaPPWVlsdwc?si=n1XE-bGpQ_O9wS69UGQFug\" title=\"My Spotify Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-spotify\" style={{ color: \"#1ed761\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"}\n                                <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/robbiegay\" title=\"My SoundCloud Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-soundcloud\" style={{ color: \"#ff6c02\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"}\n                                {/* <a href=\"https://robbiegay.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"My BandCamp Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-bandcamp\" style={{ color: \"#1ea1c3\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"} */}\n                                {/* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/robbiegay\" title=\"My YouTube Channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-youtube\" style={{ color: \"#ff0000\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a> */}\n                                {/* Hack to spread the icons evenly across the line */}\n                                <span style={{ width: \"100%\", display: \"inline-block\" }}></span>\n                            </p>\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col xs={3}></Col>\n                    </Row>\n                </Container>\n            </PageFormat>\n\n            <Footer />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Music;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Card, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction AuthorCard(props) {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <heading>\n                <h1 className=\"pt-4 pb-3 text-center\">{props.title}</h1>\n\n                <Card style={{maxWidth: \"300px\"}}>\n                    <Row className=\"no-gutters\">\n                        <Col xs={4}>\n                            <Card.Img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/images/headshot-march-2020.jpg\"} />\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col xs={8}>\n                            <Card.Body>\n                                <Card.Title>Robbie Gay</Card.Title>\n                                <Card.Text>{props.date}</Card.Text>\n                            </Card.Body>\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row>\n                </Card>\n                <br />\n\n            </heading>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default AuthorCard;","import React from \"react\";\n\nfunction PWWeek1() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Welcome!</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Welcome to my blog!

What I liked\n                    most about this was the confidence meter and the resource density sections.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    I think that anyone who has tried to learn a new skill has likely experienced that initial boost\n                    in confidence.\n                    You start learning a new skill and (because you started at zero) you progress very quickly.\n                    You’re flying through\n                    the plethora of beginner's resources and climbing the learning curve so rapidly that you’re\n                    <em>convinced</em> that\n                    this time next week you’ll be working for Google. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Then you crest that initial hill. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    When you started, you didn’t know enough to know what you didn’t know. As such, you felt like it\n                    would be pretty\n                    simple to acquire all of the information you would need. Now, after a few weeks of rapid\n                    learning, you finally know\n                    enough about whatever skill you are learning to realize just how much you have left to learn.\n                    Your small pond\n                    turned out to be a big ocean. And that’s where the confidence drop comes from — correspondingly,\n                    it’s also likely\n                    that this is where most newcomers flame out.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    To add to this blow, the graphic also shows a rapid increase in resource\n                    scarcity. My own thoughts on this are that there are two markets for those who create such\n                    resources:\n                </p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Beginners</li>\n                    <li>Experts (Paid Professionals)</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>\n                    In most fields, there are likely way more people in the beginning market than at any other\n                    junction.\n                    So, despite the fact that beginners likely aren’t making money yet\n                    (and therefore don’t have much money to invest in learning resources), the sheer size of this\n                    market makes\n                    it appealing for resource creators to create content for. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    At the other end of the spectrum, experts likely represent a small percentage of the total\n                    audience. Since they are paid for\n                    their work, however, they can likely afford to pay a premium for advanced level knowledge\n                    resources. This leaves\n                    a small market for those skill-learners who are beyond the scope of the beginner resource but\n                    below the level\n                    of the expert resource. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    This creates a “desert of despair”, as the graphic calls it, where your confidence level is\n                    knocked down\n                    several pegs AND those learning resources that helped you advance so quickly early on are\n                    becoming more\n                    and more scarce. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    This learning curve graphic goes on to point out that:\n                </p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Despite this feeling of hopelessness, <strong>others before you have had the same\n                            experience</strong>.\n                        The graphic encourages us to keep pushing.</li>\n                    <li>Despite the fluctuations in confidence and resources, your competencey is steadily\n                        increasing\n                        throughout this journey.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>\n                    Note: I didn’t mention the 3rd category, \"scope of knowledge\" — that’s basically showing how a\n                    beginner\n                    absorbs broad fundamentals early on before specializing (and decreasing total breadth of\n                    knowledge) later on in their journey.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    ~Phew~ Sorry for the big rant on learning curves — on to the meat and potatoes of Prework Week\n                    1.\n                    <br /><br />\n\n                    <h3>DVCS: Git and GitHub</h3>\n\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The focus of our first week of prework was getting up to speed on Git and Github.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    What is Git?\n                </p>\n\n                <blockquote className=\"blockquote bg-light px-5 py-2 my-4 rounded-pill\">\n                    \"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything\n                    from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.” <cite className=\"blockquote-footer\"><a\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a></cite>\n                </blockquote>\n\n                <p>\n                    Great — but what is a DVCS?<br />\n                    <br />\n                    To start, VCS is a Version Control System. My one-week-of-coding-experience definition of a VCS\n                    is that it allows you to track and document changes to code (including reverting to older\n                    versions\n                    of the code). A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a VCS that is mirrored on multiple\n                    devices.\n                    For example, if I have a full copy of the code on my computer and you have an identical copy on\n                    yours,\n                    then we have a <em>distributed</em> copy of the code.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    But what if I change my copy — now our copies aren't aligned, right? That’s where the “version\n                    control system”\n                    comes into play.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    A DVCS like Git tracks any changes I make, and then allows me to merge those changes into a\n                    shared code.\n                    You could then update your copy of the code to match that shared code, and then add your own\n                    changes.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com\" title=\"GitHub\">GitHub</a> is a cloud based code repository. So, if\n                    we each\n                    have our copies of the code, we could place a third copy on GitHub. This saves us time, as I no\n                    longer\n                    have to drive to your house for us to compare code versions.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/git-stages.png\" alt=\"Example of Git Workflow\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Source: <a className=\"minimalLink\"\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository\">\"Intro\n                            to Git\"</a></figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    This oversimplified explanation of Git doesn’t even begin to get into some of the more complex\n                    (or, to me, confusing) functions of Git.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Challenges</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I found Git pretty hard to understand. For one, working in Command Line meant that there wasn’t\n                    much\n                    of a user interface. It sometimes felt like you were flying in the dark — entering commands and\n                    receiving\n                    little to no visual or textual confirmation of what you are doing.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/why-git-is-confusing.png\"\n                        alt=\"Why Git is so confusing\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Source: <a\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows\">\"Intro to\n                            Git\"</a> (added text mine)</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that helped me was reaching out to my brother, William.{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com/1GWilly8\" title=\"William's GitHub\">William</a>{\" \"}\n                    graduated with a <a href=\"https://www.hanover.edu/academics/programs/cs\"\n                        title=\"Hanover College Computer Science\"><abbr title=\"Computer Science\">CS</abbr> degree</a>{\" \"}\n                    in 2018 and has been working for an <a href=\"https://glowlabs.co\" title=\"Glow Labs\">\n                        <abbr title=\"Internet of Things\">IoT</abbr> company</a> in Denver.

We are working\n                    remotely and I wasn’t really sure what the workload would be like. I found it\n                    to be challenging but manageable, although (perhaps more importantly) I also found it to be\n                    really\n                    fun! I really enjoyed that there is so much to learn at this phase. I also really\n                    liked that so much of the work involves getting hands-on and creating web pages.\n                    Even though the websites we are building are very basic, it felt very satisfying\n                    to be able to apply what we had just learned and see the changes come to life!<br />\n                    <br />\n                    I am really excited to continue working through these prework topics. I’ve enjoyed\n                    some of the design aspects of CSS, and am really looking forward to working with\n                    JavaScript to build more responsive websites!<br />\n                    <br />\n                    I found Git and CSS relatively harder than HTML. The application process for the bootcamp\n                    involved an HTML assignment, and I worked through a Coding Academy course on HTML to help me\n                    with that. I found Git challenging due to the lack of a\n                    <abbr title=\"User Interface\">UI</abbr> as well as some confusion about the various intricacies\n                    of branching, merging, rebasing, etc. I found CSS challenging mostly in the amount of\n                    information to absorb. I think that with both Git and CSS, more time spent working with\n                    them will help me to better digest the information.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    A final reflection is that I really love working in an academic setting that doesn’t\n                    involve quizzes or grades! I think that this is really refreshing — instead of making\n                    flashcards and doing rote memorization, you can approach the subject\n                    matter in whichever way helps you to best absorb and apply the material!\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">A Bonus Resource</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    The prompt for our first blog post asked us for a resource that would help others in the\n                    program.\n                    I’m sure that most bootcampers know of or use something similar to this, but I found an\n                    online coding platform like <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" title=\"CodePen\">CodePen</a>{\" \"}\n                    really helpful.

HTML provides the\n                        structure of your webpage and CSS gives it its style. If HTML\n                        is like the frame of your house, CSS is the doors, windows,\n                        paint, etc:\n                    </p>\n\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/html-vs-css.png\" alt=\"Visual analogy of HTML vs CSS\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">HTML is like the frame of a house; CSS adds\n                            style.</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n\n                    <p>\n                        We covered a range of basic HTML and CSS topics, and although\n                        I would love to write a post covering <em>everything</em> we\n                        learned, I would also love to go to sleep at some point tonight.\n                        Instead, here is a very basic introduction to HTML/CSS!\n                    </p>\n\n                    {/* <!--|| HTML Intro --> */}\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">HTML: A very basic introduction</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        The basic building block of HTML is the element.

Pseudo Code is\n                        really useful in the brainstorming phase of your code writing\n                        process, as it allows you to find a happy medium between\n                        super technical real code, and regular, everyday English.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Why find this middle ground? Jumping right into code can be\n                        like starting a journey without any sort of road map. Pseudo code gives\n                        you a chance to outline your work, and maybe see what problems\n                        and challenges you are likely to face. You may be able to\n                        solve some of those problems in this outline, perhaps saving\n                        you the time of starting in the wrong direction!\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Pseudo Code is not full code. The meaning of this is that you\n                        don’t have to worry about the code being technically correct —\n                        there’s no getting bogged down in the complexities of figuring\n                        out how to solve certain problems. For example, in your Pseudo\n                        Code, you might realize that you need to invent a new\n                        algorithm for streaming video. Instead of putting down the pen\n                        and spending hours/days/years (I have no idea how long it take\n                        to write an algorithm) writing your new algorithm, it is enough\n                        to simply know that it is needed — plot it on your roadmap and\n                        move on.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        At the same time, you would want to avoid full on English.\n                        Saying “go find the peanut butter” might not mean much to a\n                        computer. Humans are great at making inferences and thinking\n                        creatively, computers are very literal. While you don’t need\n                        to actually map out, via full-blown code, how to get your\n                        robot/computer to find the peanut better, you should at least\n                        acknowledge the basic steps: locate kitchen, locate pantry,\n                        find peanut butter.\n                    </p>\n\n                    {/* <!--|| Prework Week 3 Reflection --> */}\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Reflection</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        I really enjoyed Prework Week Two of the Awesome Inc.

We worked through the\n                        MDN Intro readings on the topic, and I found myself rereading\n                        them today for the 3rd time, taking notes, and only now\n                        starting to feel more comfortable understanding topics such as{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#Inheritance\"\n                            title=\"MDN Guide to Inheritance\">inheritance</a>,{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#Conflicting_rules\"\n                            title=\"MDN Guide to Cascade\">cascade</a>, and{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model\"\n                            title=\"MDN Guide to Box Model\">box model</a>.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        HTML came a bit more easily. An assignment for acceptance into the Bootcamp\n                        involved building a basic HTML site. To help me\n                        build that, I signed up for a free trial of Code Academy Pro\n                        and worked through an Introduction to HTML course. Having even\n                        a brief sampler of HTML helped me get through the HTML\n                        fundaments more easily.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        I found Pseudo Code really interesting to work with. It’s\n                        really helpful to create an outline and to be able to\n                        (mentally) run through your program and know that it might\n                        (<em>hopefully</em>) work. This is nice because you can build a roadmap\n                        without becoming caught up with the various typos and small\n                        errors that your code might have initially. With Pseudo Code,\n                        you are making a good faith effort to ensure that your\n                        top-level logic is sound!\n                    </p>\n\n                    {/* <!--|| Resources --> */}\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Resources</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Two resources that I found helpful were{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com\" title=\"Google Fonts\">Google Fonts</a>{\" \"}\n                        and Google's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker\" title=\"Online Color Picker\">\n                            online color selector</a>.

Additionally, we\n                    did our first Demo Day on Friday! As we are working remotely, this\n                    was done via group video chat. We all took turns demonstrating the\n                    functionality of our Silly Story Generators, as well as looking\n                    under the hood and showcasing/explaining the source code behind\n                    our projects.\n                    </p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">JavaScript</h3>\n                <p>\n                    JavaScript is a coding language that is used on both the client\n                    and server sides.

JavaScript <strong>IS NOT</strong> the same\n            as the similarly popular programing language, Java. In fact, the\n            only reason that they are named in a similar fashion is because\n            Java was becoming very popular at the time, and the creators of\n            JavaScript thought that they could benefit from Java’s popularity\n            by adopting a similar name.

What looks nice and spacious on\n                    a widescreen, became very compressed on a mobile device.\n                    </p>\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/css-not-scaling-well-to-mobile.png\"\n                        alt=\"CSS not scaling well to mobile view\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The same blog post viewed on a mobile device\n                        </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>\n                    Unfortunately, attempting to remedy this made things much worse\n                    before they got any better. For a while, not only did the site not\n                    look good on mobile, but elements started to appear in strange\n                    places on desktop as well.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    Although we learned about Git in our first week of Prework, it\n                    wasn’t until I attempted to resize my blog that I became a real\n                        believer. I should first say that this came about <em>not</em>\n                    because I used Git properly and that it helped me to fix my\n                    website, but rather, that I didn’t use a good Gitflow Strategy,\n                    and that I ended up wishing fervently that I had!\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    I was using a “dev” (development) branch to write my code, but\n                    only doing so so that I could get into the habit. Once I had an\n                    update, I would immediately merge with the local master branch and\n                    then push to GitHub. This was unfortunate, because even though my code\n                    was moving in the right direction, things, at least temporarily,\n                    looked worse than before. If I had been using Git properly, I\n                    could have left my master branch as a functioning version of the\n                    site, while working on my dev branch until things were up to\n                    publication quality. This process definitely made be a believer in\n                    the usefulness of using a Version Control System like Git!\n                    </p>\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    A second thing that I struggled with this week was encountering\n                        logic errors in my <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/silly-story/\"\n                        title=\"Robbie's Silly Story Generator\">Silly Story Generator</a>.\n            The SSG is supposed to take a string of text and, somewhat{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs\" title=\"Mad Libs Wikipedia\">Mad Libs</a> style,\n                                insert funny\n                                characters and locations to generate a new “silly story” each time\n                                the “generate” button is pressed.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    A piece of additional functionality that I wanted to add involved\n                    creating a Typewriter Effect, where each letter would appear one\n                    at a time, as if being typed. Needless to say, this did not work\n                    as planned either the first (or twenty-first) time that I tried to\n                    run the program. The first thing that I looked for were syntax\n                    errors. You can think of these as grammar or spelling mistakes.\n                    This is like when you text someone: “on my way, soon” when you\n                    really meant to say “one my way, noon” — A simple error that might\n                    have someone waiting around for several hours. Computers being\n                    very literal machines, these simple grammar and spelling errors\n                    can cause a program to cease functioning entirely.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    After first addressing any syntactical errors that I could find in\n                    my Silly Story Generator, I then had to deal with any logic\n                    errors. A logic error is when you tell a program how to perform a\n                    task, they are able to complete said task, but then, because of an\n                    error in the logic of your instructions, the task completed does\n                    not produce the desired results.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    A real-world example of a logic error could be to give someone\n                    directions to your house. Perhaps you managed to spell everything\n                    correctly and produce easy to follow directions (no syntax\n                    errors), but you then told them to turn left on Main St. instead\n                    of right! The instructions worked well, they just sent your friend\n                    in the wrong direction.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    I found dealing with logic errors really frustrating. I would find\n                    myself reading and rereading my code, and eventually coming to the\n                        conclusion that my code definitely <em>should</em> work; It\n                        <em>seemed</em> like everything made sense. There were even\n                                moments when I would just stare at the screen, unable to find\n                                anything to tweak or try.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    It seemed like there were no real “ah-ha” moments of getting this\n                    week's code to work — rather than a large change that fixed the\n                    program, it was several small implementations that eventually\n                    built some functioning code.{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer\"\n                        title=\"Pragmatic Programmer Wikipedia\">The\n                            Pragmatic Programmer</a>{\" \"}\n                    mentions a Japanese phrase, “kaizen”.

When working in HTML, there is a lot of\n                    framework that gets recycled on every page. After my first couple\n                    of webpages, I got tired of repeatedly building the same\n                    structure. I had decided that it would be really useful to build a\n                    template to start with. It was then that fellow Bootcamper{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://anchormansam.github.io/my-blog/blog.html\" title=\"A link to Sam's Blog\">Sam</a>\n                    mentioned a\n                    useful shortcut\n                    in the class Slack (groupchat).

Justin\n                                    walked us\n                                    through the\n                                    process of using the Chrome Dev Tools to debug a program.

For example, if my code wasn’t\n                                    displaying a string pulled from an array, is that because it isn’t\n                                    pulling the string from the array at all, or is the computer\n                                    having trouble inputting said string back into our story? With\n                                    Chrome Dev Tools, you are able to insert a breakpoint, and to then\n                        <em>see</em> how the computer is thinking.

We started with another{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks\"\n                        title=\"JavaScript Building Blocks\">MDN module</a>, this one\n                introducing us to some more JavaScript building blocks — things\n                like loops, functions, return values, and events.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    Next, we moved on to four coding projects. Our first project still\n                        involved a little bit of handholding.

After the Image\n                    Gallery project, however, we were on our own.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    My biggest takeaway from this week's assignments has been that I\n                        have become a pretty big Pseudo Code enthusiast!

I\n                        <em>did</em> jot down a rough outline of the code, but didn’t\n                    bother to mentally run through the various steps of my proposed\n                    coding plan.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    I then jumped right into writing the code, and several hours later, I\n                    was approaching something that resembled a Countdown Timer.\n                    It was only when I was trying to work in some final bits of\n                    functionality, that I realized that my initial approach was\n                    fatally flawed. Had I used Pseudo Code to work through the logical\n                        flow of my program <strong>before</strong> I started writing\n                    code, then I likely would have realized some of these late-stage\n                    mistakes early on. Instead, I ended up having to rewrite a lot of\n                    my code, costing me several additional hours. Starting with Pseudo\n                    Code would likely have saved me both time and headaches\n                    </p>\n                <blockquote className=\"blockquote bg-light px-5 py-2 my-4 rounded-pill\">\n                    \"Measure twice, cut once\"\n                        <cite className=\"blockquote-footer\">Justin (and just about anyone else who has ever built\n                            anything)</cite>\n                </blockquote>\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Reflection: The Prework Period</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Each week of Prework presented different challenges and opportunities.{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-1.html\" title=\"PW Week 1 Blog Post\">Week\n                            1</a>{\" \"}\n                    introduced\n                    us to Git, Github,\n                    and Command Line. A lot of these new technologies felt very\n                    confusing at first. After 4 weeks of (nearly) daily practice, I\n                    think I am starting to feel more comfortable... at least with the\n                    basics.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-2.html\" title=\"PW Week 2 Blog Post\">Week\n                            2</a>{\" \"}\n                    introduced\n                    us to HTML and\n                    CSS, and saw us creating our first blog posts! I found the\n                    structuring of HTML to be fairly straightforward. Conversely, I\n                    really struggled with getting CSS to work. It was challenging to\n                    try to understand the various parent/child relationships between\n                    the different elements, or to figure out how different properties got\n                    inherited or overwritten. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect\n                    though, was finally getting your webpage looking how you want\n                    it to, only to realize that, if viewed on anything other than\n                        a browser window of <strong>exactly the same size</strong>,\n                    that things weren't going to look anything close to how you\n                    laid them out.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/pw-week-3.html\" title=\"PW Week 3 Blog Post\">Week\n                            3</a>{\" \"}\n                    introduced\n                    us to\n                    JavaScript, while Week 4 added some more fundamentals\n                    to our knowledge portfolio. Most of the challenges of working with\n                    JavaScript involved coping with the various highs and lows of\n                    creative problem solving. First came the high of the eureka moment when you\n                        became <strong>convinced</strong> of a solution to your current\n                    problem. Then, the low of this solution only managing to break\n                    what you had working before. One thing that helped was to not\n                    immediately wad your new idea up and throw it in the trash.\n                    I found that many times, pausing to comb through your code for\n                    syntax errors could be really helpful — as maybe your new solution\n                        <em>might</em> actually work if you hadn’t misspelled a variable\n                    or left out a bracket.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    Another thing that I found really helpful was occasionally closing\n                    my computer. For one, just taking breaks and maybe mulling over a\n                    problem while you took a walk could often leave to breakthroughs,\n                    to thinking, \"why hadn't I thought of that yet\". And second, I\n                    found that beginning your code with just pen and paper was a really helpful\n                    way to start. By forcing myself to slow down, to work through ALL\n                    the steps of the problem, and to chart out ALL the functionalities\n                    I would need, would often lead to developing a better roadmap and\n                    better code. I was then able, still with\n                    pen and paper, to start solving these problems and adding\n                    various functionalities. This made the act of writing the code\n                    a little bit like filling in the blanks.\n                    </p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Bootcamp</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I am <strong>super</strong> excited to start Bootcamp Week 1 on Monday!\n                    </p>\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/time-till-bootcamp-starts.png\"\n                        alt=\"Countdown till Sept. 16th, 2019\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Counting down to Day 1!</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>\n                    I felt like we learned a lot more than I expected to in this\n                    introductory period, and I am really stoked to see what we\n                    will be learning in our first few weeks of Bootcamp!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default PWWeek4;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\n\nfunction PWWeek2() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    We just wrapped up Bootcamp Week 1 — it was really\n                    exciting to dive into our first week of full-time\n                    coding, but it also came with some personal highs and lows.\n                    A high was that the first week of Bootcamp was a\n                    lot of fun!

After our design workshop wrapped\n                    up, I turned back to my blog and realized just how much additional\n                    design work my blog could use! I really enjoyed learning more\n                    about design, and am looking forward to our future design theory sessions.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    This week we started working with the Bootstrap framework. A framework\n                    is a software abstraction that adds certain functionality to common code.\n                    The main difference between a framework and a library is \"inversion of control\" —\n                    in a framework, the global flow of control is employed by the framework, rather\n                    than the user. What using Bootstrap meant for me, was that I could\n                    take something that previously took me 40-50 lines of CSS, and enter only a\n                    word or two of Bootstrap and achieve the same effect… often with\n                    even better results. Switching from vanilla CSS to Bootstrap was\n                    a bit like being given superpowers — it was amazing what sort of\n                    features I could add to my blog with just a few Bootstrap classes!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">JavaScript Objects</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I definitely struggled with understanding JavaScript objects at\n                        first. I tried reading the “objects” chapter in{\" \"}\n                    <a title=\"Eloquent JavaScript\" href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html\">“Eloquent JavaScript”</a>{\" \"}\n                    on Monday. By “tried to read”, I mean that I made it about halfway through\n                    before becoming so lost that I only skimmed the rest, knowing that nothing else was going to\n                        stick. Later in the week, I began working through the <a title=\"MDN JS Objects Module\"\n                        href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects\"> MDN JavaScript\n                        Objects module</a>.

Each of these projects was built\n                    using JavaScript, and each helped introduce us to some\n                    new aspect of the language.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>This Week’s Projects</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/weather-app/\" title=\"My Weather App\">The Weather App</a>{\" \"}\n                    was designed to take a user-inputted zip-code, and output\n                    real-time weather conditions for that area. This project\n                    introduced us to APIs and JSON. APIs are Application\n                    Programming Interfaces, sets of code governing access\n                    points to servers or databases. JSON stands for JavaScript\n                    Object Notation, and is a standardized data format.

This test was run upon\n                    each firing of the click event handler.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/calculator/\" title=\"My Calculator App\">Calculator</a>{\" \"}\n                    project involved building a basic calculator that could use\n                     +, -, /, x on user-inputted numbers. This project seemed pretty\n                     straight forward at first — computers should be pretty good\n                     at adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying. The problem,\n                     however, lay in the fact that there are a multitude of\n                     combinations for which the user could input values. What\n                     happens if the user presses: - + 5 6 - / 3 =? Should the computer\n                     ignore the opening two operands? 5 and 6 pressed sequentially\n                     should obviously form “56”. And what about the “- /“? Should\n                     the computer ignore the first operand in this case as well?\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    There were many edge cases, and, on my first attempt at creating\n                    the calculator, I tried to solve all of these scenarios from\n                    the beginning. This resulted in a somewhat functioning calculator,\n                    but at the expense of running some very convoluted code behind\n                    the scenes. I decided to start fresh and create a second JS sheet,\n                    and to focus on just solving core problems first. After I had\n                    some fairly clean code working, I then began to\n                    incrementally add edge case solutions.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Additionally, the Calculator was my first time dynamically\n                    rendering an application in JavaScript. The body of my HTML\n                    document only contains a single &lt;div&gt; element for the\n                    JavaScript to build the app on.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Process</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    My biggest take away from Bootcamp Week 2 was that I started\n                    to think about and establish a personal development process.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My first step is to read over the project parameters, and to\n                    Pseudo Code the problem. I will draw out the potential UI,\n                    thinking about how various elements will scale at different\n                    screen sizes, as well as what elements are clickable and how\n                    various elements should interact. I will work on the\n                    code as well — mapping out ideas relating to how I think\n                    the problem could be solved.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I will then usually go ahead and build my UI. This gives me\n                    something to work with and test code upon. If you need to\n                    test what happens when a button gets pressed, it’s pretty\n                    hard to do so if you haven’t built any buttons yet!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My next step is to build the core functionality of the project.\n                    This MVP will fulfill the broad requirements for functionality,\n                    while leaving edge cases to a later step. Throughout this\n                    process, I will likely come up with ideas for new features,\n                    or think of possible edge case problems. In order to not get\n                    sidetracked, I will jot down these ideas on a pad of paper.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Once I get the core functionality working, I will then begin\n                        solving for edge cases. <a href=\"http://ianrios.me/\" title=\"Ian's Website\">Ian</a>{\" \"}\n                    recommended that I prioritize edge cases by using a four-quadrant\n                    grid.

My uncle has been in town from California all week and we went out to eat… a lot. On Saturday, we all went to the UK football game. It was a tough win, but UK seemed to metaphorically drag their season back on track. After breaking our 3 game losing streak, we get rewarded with a trip down south to play number 10 Georgia next weekend. The Bulldogs opened as a 27-point favorite, so it should be a very <i>exciting</i> game.

This involved working with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" title=\"MDN Documentation - Local Storage\">Local Storage API</a> to store entries even when you close your web browser or refresh the page. One useful thing that I did for the To-Do app — and which I might do again in the future — was to write some code for custom hotkeys. During the development process, I would often change my code and needed to test it with a totally refreshed page. Since Local Storage retains data between page loads, it became more difficult to quickly load a brand new version of the webpage. Because of this, I decided to map the <code>=</code> key to some lines of code that cleared the Local Storage (as well as emptying the array the held data related to the To-Do List entries). Additionally, I mapped the <code>-</code> key to trigger several useful <code>console.log()</code>’s. This meant that I could quickly get a status update on several of the key functions of the app — without these logs cluttering up the console upon every action.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/to-do-custom-hotkeys.png\" alt=\"My To-Do code\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">I mapped some custom hotkeys in my To-Do List app</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Frameworks and Libraries</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    The prompt for this week’s blog post asked: “Why do you see JavaScript frameworks and libraries [as] useful or hard to use?” I thought that this was an interesting question, as I would likely answer that I find frameworks and libraries as both useful AND hard to use (at least at first).\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    JavaScript frameworks and libraries are really useful — they abstract away a lot of functionality, allowing you to write code that is both clean and highly functional. Cleaner code allows for easier debugging and maintenance. Additionally, many of the functionalities contained within these frameworks or libraries solve complex problems that took entire teams of highly skilled individuals to solve. Many coders (especially novice ones like myself) would be hard pressed to solve these problems, let alone with code that remains remotely legible.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    And in answer to the second part of the prompt: I also think that frameworks and libraries can be difficult to learn. Picking up any new aspect of coding can be challenging. You often work really hard to attain some level of competency in a certain area, and then a new framework or library comes knocking at our door. This new tech offers increased functionality and powerful new features, but comes at the cost of jumping (yet again) into the <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/blog/coding_is_hard_confidence_competence.png\" title=\"Graphic from Erik Trautman's 'Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard'\">desert of despair</a>. Couple this with the fact that you may then have to refactor many of your old projects in order to incorporate this new tech, and you might be tempted to slam your door on the framework/library salesman and go back to the comfort of your old code. As tempting as this is, I think that the added functionality of new frameworks/libraries, as well as the opportunity to keep your 'learning muscle' strong, more than justifies the mental discomfort and extra work — even if it will always remain tempting to stay within your comfort zone --> &#128563;.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    [Bonus content: Since I added an emoji above, here is a <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp\" title=\"w3schools - Emoji Reference Page\">great resource</a> for adding emoji's to your code!]\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Coming Attractions: React</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Next week we will begin working with the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\" title=\"The React Website\">React library</a>. React is billed as a “JavaScript library for building user interfaces”. I am really excited to make this jump! We have been working with <abbr title=\"Plain JavaScript without any additional Frameworks or Libraries\">Vanilla JavaScript</abbr> for several weeks now, and although Vanilla JS was very challenging at first, I have started to get fairly comfortable, at least with the more basic applications that we have been building. As such, I’m really excited to dive in and get out of my comfort zone!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">VS Code Snippets</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    One resource that I found this week that was really helpful was this article on <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets\" title=\"VS Code Documentation — Snippets\">creating VS Code snippets</a>. Snippets are lines of text that you can program to auto-complete into useful lines of code! I wrote a snippet for quickly adding <code>console-log()</code>’s to my code: you type in <code>lll</code> (three lowercase L’s), and then press <code>Enter</code>. This converts the <code>lll</code> into a new <code>console.log();</code>, with the text input cursor placed in the parentheses for quickly typing what you want to log. I chose the letter L because it is next to the enter key, allowing for very quick implementation!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek4;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek5() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    A lot of things happened this week — buckle up for a relatively long weekly update!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">The Big Chop</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    On Wednesday, I scheduled my first haircut in nearly 5 years!\n                    I started growing my hair out in January of 2016, with the\n                    intention of one day having a “man bun”. By the Fall of 2016,\n                    my hair was finally long enough to go up in a bun… and from\n                    there it just kept growing and growing!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Over the last few months, I had started to get a little tired\n                    of its extreme length. It had gotten to the point where\n                    it was almost too long for a bun and, after showering, my\n                    hair would remain wet for hours!

React is an open source project produced by Facebook,\n                    and is billed as “A JavaScript library for building user interfaces”.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A major feature of React is its use of components.\n                    I would define a React component as a self-contained unit that\n                    compartmentalizes a certain piece of functionality. This can be\n                    very useful: you can write a component for a button. This button\n                    component can contain all of the necessary code for a button (its shape,\n                    what happens when it is clicked, etc). You can then call that\n                    button component anywhere you want to insert a button on your site.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Here is an example of a \"Card\" component that I made for our{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/react-restaurant/\">React Restaurant project</a>:\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/using-react-components.png\"\n                        alt=\"An example of a React component\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">A React Component</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    The card component creates an <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code> (header) element for\n                        the title, an <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> (header) element for the price, and\n                        a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> (paragraph) element for the description.\n                        You may have noticed the <code>&#123;this.props.mealTitle&#125;</code> lines of code —\n                                    A useful feature of components is that you can pass properties\n                        into them using <code>props</code>.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Within the Card component, I set the inner HTML of the above\n                        mentioned elements to <code>&#123;this.props.INPUT&#125;</code>. React\n                                        often uses an extension of JavaScript called{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html\" title=\"React Documentation\">JSX</a>. JSX allows\n                        you to put any valid JS expression within <code>{}</code> (curly braces),\n                                    and that expression will then be evaluated. In my example\n                        code, I placed <code>this.props.INPUT</code> within the curly\n                        braces. <code>this</code> refers to the component itself,{\" \"}\n                    <code>props</code> refers to properties of the object, and\n                        then <code>INPUT</code> is a placeholder for whatever element\n                                    you want to pass through to the component.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When I call the component, I am then able to use this syntax\n                    to pass code into the component.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/card-example.png\" alt=\"An example of component use\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Calling the \"Card\" component</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    In this example code, I pass in <code>mealTitle</code>,{\" \"}\n                    <code>mealPrice</code>, and <code>mealDescription</code>.\n                        Anything that I set these <code>props</code> equal to is inserted into\n                                        the respective React component. The result of\n                                        this example code is this:\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/card-result.png\"\n                        alt=\"The result of the component call\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The result of the component call</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    I found React fairly difficult to pick up. For the first few days,\n                    I felt like I was aimlessly adrift. There\n                    was so much to learn, that I wasn’t even sure where to turn my\n                    boat. Slowly I was able to gain a little traction — I would\n                    pick a project, experiment with React, and see what I could learn. A big part was being\n                    willing to break things and make mistakes. After I had spent\n                    some time building and breaking things, I slowly started to feel\n                    more comfortable using React!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">The Pomodoro Method</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Warm-up Coach{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://jmstewart00.github.io\" title=\"Josh's Website\">Josh</a>{\" \"}\n                    has recommended before that we take breaks. For me, a break typically\n                    involved reading some content online or checking my phone. Unfortunately,\n                    this isn’t really a ‘break’ as far as our brain is concerned — we\n                    are merely switching from one type of stimulus to another. As such,\n                    on Friday I decided to try the Pomodoro Method, and to start taking real breaks.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Pomodoro\n                            Method</a>{\" \"}\n                    involves setting a timer, working with laser focus for a defined length of\n                    time, and then taking a short break. Here is an example of how these\n                    breaks would work:\n                    </p>\n\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li>25 minutes of work</li>\n                    <li>5 minute break</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <p>\n                    After 4 of these Pomodoros, you then take a longer 15-30 minute break. An\n                    important aspect of a Pomodoro is that it is indivisible —\n                    you have to work for the full 25 minutes, and you have to maintain\n                    your state of focus throughout. I found that I was able to keep my\n                    focus much more effectively in these short bursts. Beyond this improved\n                    focus, I found the real value in the type of breaks that I took.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    During my Pomodoro breaks, I tried to do something that didn’t involve a screen. Here are some\n                    examples of breaks that I took:\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>Short walk around the block</li>\n                        <li>Light stretching in the hallway (lots of great natural light!)</li>\n                        <li>Same hallway: opened the window, felt the sun and wind on my face, and did some\n                                yoga-like mindful breathing</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    These breaks might seem silly, but it was amazing how much a short break like\n                    this improved my cognitive function. Every time I returned from these\n                    breaks, I sat down at my desk totally refreshed! I found that I had the same\n                    level of energy that I was used to experiencing only at the start of the day!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Remembering and following through with taking breaks\n                    can be a challenge — It can be pretty tempting to remain in your chair! That\n                    said, I hope to continue to take breaks like this, as I think that they\n                    really help me do my best work!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek5;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek2() {\n    return (\n        <>\n{/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n                <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Weekly Update</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Week 6 of the Bootcamp was pretty fun!{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://wildercat.github.io/\" title=\"Abram's Blog\">Abram</a>{\" \"}\n                        brought in his GameCube and we played some lunchtime{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee\" title=\"Wikipedia Page\">Melee</a>. \n                        Todd showed us his favorite game —{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_(video_game)\" title=\"Wikipedia Page\">Monkey Ball</a> — \n                        it was pretty fun but I was not very good at it.

I am very excited, however, to \n                        graduate and pursue a job in Lexington’s Tech scene!\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">React Reflection</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        As I wrote in <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/posts/bc-week-5.html\">last week’s blog post</a>, \n                        I initially struggled with understanding React. It took me most of week 5 before I even \n                        felt like I was gaining any traction. Last weekend, I got a full night's sleep \n                        and spent part of Sunday re-reading the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">React documentation</a>. \n                        This week, I worked through the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">React tutorial</a>{\" \"}\n                        for the second time, and read through the documentation \n                        a third. Each time through, I would make it further and further before my comprehension \n                        level would start to drop. By the end of the week, I was starting to feel well \n                        versed in the basics of React — just in time to switch gears and start learning \n                        MySQL and PHP. &#128579;\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Next Week: Back End Development</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Next week we will start working with Back End languages. Up until this point, we have \n                        been working with Front End languages and frameworks. Front End development \n                        is more client side focused and deals with design and user interfaces. Back End development involves \n                        working with servers and doing more behind-the-scenes work. Additionally, being able to do \n                        both Front End and Back End development is what makes someone a Full Stack Developer!                           \n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        We will start Back End work by learning <a href=\"https://www.php.net/\">PHP</a>{\" \"}\n                        and <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a>.

We built a practice server,\n            and attempted to build an API that could pull data from that server.\n            I might have gone a little bit overboard when I decided to add 1,000,000\n            items to my nonsense database…\n                        </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/million-item-db.png\" alt=\"My example database\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">1 million food items</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    About midweek, we jumped into{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://laravel.com/\" title=\"The Laravel Website\">Laravel</a>.\n            Laravel is a PHP framework that is billed as an elegant and\n            expressive means to do Back End programming. I have really\n            enjoyed learning Laravel so far. We have been working our\n            way through this\n                            \"<a href=\"https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch\" title=\"Laracasts\">Laravel 6 From Scratch</a>\"\n    video series. I find it to be a pretty fun way to learn!\n    I follow along with the video, pausing it to apply what\n    I just learned to my own code. Once I feel like I\n    have come to an understanding about some topic, I then try to\n    summarize it in my notes.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around chapter 3 of the Laracast series, my comprehension\n                    level started to drop. I found the same thing happening\n                    with several of our recent learning endeavors (React, PHP). I\n                    will make a decent amount of progress, but then the wave of\n                    confusion washes over me and I have to swim back to shore.\n                    A solution that I have found is to go ahead and skim over\n                    the remaining material. I don’t stress about the fact that\n                    I am not entirely following along. Rather, I am trying to\n                    get a broad picture, to see how the pieces fit together.\n                    I then go back and read (or watch) the material again.\n                    When I started getting lost in the Laracasts, I turned\n                    the playback speed to 2x and powered through the remaining videos. This\n                    allowed me to get a broad overview of many of the cool Laravel features.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that I have been struggling with is getting enough\n                    sleep. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not falling asleep in class,\n                    but when learning new material, I find that even a little\n                    bit of extra fatigue really hinders my ability to learn\n                    new concepts. My goal for next week, is to go to bed an\n                    hour earlier! That plan sounds great, except that I had\n                    the same goal last week. Oh well.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I slept in both Saturday and Sunday mornings, and then started\n                    rewatching the Laracasts. I found this really helpful — I\n                    was fresh and alert, and was able to absorb the material\n                    really well. I am really starting to see how useful Laravel\n                    is. Right now, its only hindrance is that it is\n                    so full of features that it can be a little difficult to\n                    understand at first. While working with JavaScript, I would\n                    create one or two JS files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.\n                            When I run <code>Laravel new project name</code>, it makes\n    a massive amount of files. I just went through and tried to count\n    how many files this actually does create. I was around 140~\n    when I got into the vendor bin and realized that it\n    would be a waste of time to keep counting. This is obviously\n    a great thing — look how much functionality comes built in\n    to Laravel. It does mean, however, that the learning curve is a little\n    bit steep, and a fair bit intimidating. I look forward to a\n    time when I can make better use of some of these powerful features!\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Next week we start the week off with a remote day!{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\" title=\"The Donald's Twitter Page\">President Trump</a>{\" \"}\n                    is holding a political rally in the evening, and most of\n                    downtown will be blocked off starting at 2pm.

The first task\n                    on everyone’s plate was to setup our login and logout functionality. I think\n                    that most of us expected this to be a fairly quick process, and therefore budgeted\n                    a lot of time for other stories. By Friday’s Demo Day, very few people had made\n                    it past the login/logout step.

Taking the time to really plan out our\n                    project should hopefully save us a lot of time later on — if\n                    there’s one thing I have learned in the Bootcamp, it is the\n                        dangers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding\" title=\"Wikipedia: Cowboy Coding\">cowboy coding</a>.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Despite the detailed planning, I still had to remain pretty flexible\n                    during this first week of development. I planned on onboarding two\n                        frameworks/libraries,{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\" title=\"Tone.js Homepage\">Tone.js</a>{\" \"}\n                    (for sound) and{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://ptsjs.org/\" title=\"Pts.js Homepage\">Pts.js</a>{\" \"}\n                    (for visuals). The documentation pages for both of these frameworks/libraries\n                    talked about how simple they are to learn, and the example code was\n                    often only 10-15 lines long. Because of this, I had a certain time\n                    expectation for incorporating in these new techs. Nothing ever\n                    goes quite as planned, and it turned out that Pts doesn’t work all\n                        that well with React (I had to download an auxiliary package{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pts-canvas\" title=\"NPM: react-pts-canvas\">react-pts-canvas</a>).\n                    I ended up getting the synth to work more quickly than the visuals,\n                    and headed into the weekend with a working synth with basic control parameters.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The first week of our final project sprint had its highs and lows.\n                    I really enjoyed the planning process, and was definitely excited\n                    to get started! It was rewarding to see aspects of the process come\n                    to life, although there were times when things weren't working, and I\n                    ended up with less functioning code than I started the day with. Next\n                    week we will only have 3 class days to work on the project before\n                    breaking for Thanksgiving.

My synth parameters would store their values in state,\n                    and my first task this week was to try to store these values in my database.\n                    It was pretty straightforward to move the variables themselves, but I quickly\n                    ran into as issue with creating too many API calls.

I found that if I limited myself to one API call per second, I\n                    could mostly avoid 429 errors.\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- Carousel Images --> */}\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/mpm2-synth-controls.png\"\n                            alt=\"Synth Controls\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Basic synth controls</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/mpm2-synth-and-visualizer.png\"\n                            alt=\"Synth Visualizer\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Synth visualizer and 429 errors</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <p>\n                    My next step was to clean up my code. During the process of adding new\n                    features and trying to fix bugs, I would often “comment out” various\n                    fixes. This allowed me to see what I had tried, what had worked, and\n                    what did not. Now that I had some functioning code, I went through and\n                    deleted unused code, cleaned up existing code, and added explanatory comments.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    After lunch (a quick stop at Sahara with Sam and Anna, and a tour of{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"http://nymbl.healthcare/\" title=\"Nymbl's Website\">Nymbl’s</a>{\" \"}\n                    offices), I still had one more problem I wanted to tackle: I was separating\n                    my synth and synth control components, and knew that they wouldn’t have\n                    any common parents to pass state up to. This meant that I needed some way\n                    to store my Boolean value for triggering synth sounds. One strategy that\n                    I attempted was using{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html\" title=\"React Documentation: Context\">React context</a>.\n                Context allows you to store values outside of the parent-child tree.

At this point it\n                    was 6pm, and I decided to go home and sleep on the problem.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Tuesday</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Overslept my alarm — ended up being late to my workout class :(\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Sleeping on my API call problem worked!

I had both Ian and Justin help me, but\n                    since I was using a library (Pts.js) that they weren’t familiar with,\n                    neither of them had much luck. I stayed until 7pm, felt like I made\n                    no progress, and went home feeling a little defeated.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Wednesday</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Wednesday was our final day before Thanksgiving break, and our last day\n                    to get hands on feedback from the instructors or our classmates. With\n                    only two days of coding remaining when we get back, it was pretty vital\n                    that we be in a good position when we left on Wednesday. Since I was still\n                    solidly blocked with my visualizer issue, Justin told me that he wanted\n                    me to check in at 3pm — and that if I couldn’t solve it by then, then I\n                    may have to consider pivoting on that aspect of my project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In the morning, Ian helped me refactor my Synth and Visuals into one\n                    component. We thought that this would be helpful when attempting to\n                    analyze the sound and have the visuals react.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Since time was short, several of us decided to call in a pizza order.\n                    I asked for extra ranch. A good slice of pizza is wasted without some\n                    ranch to dip it in.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/final-project-pizza.JPG\" alt=\"Final project pizza order\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Pizza (and ranch!!!)</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    After lunch, I again worked with Ian in an attempt to fix my visualizer\n                    problem. Ian was leaving for Denver at 2pm, so time was pretty short.\n                    Ian had worked with me throughout the morning, and was now fairly familiar\n                    with Pts.js — this meant that his feedback was likely my last shot at\n                    completing this aspect of my project. As 2pm rolled around, we were\n                    both feeling pretty dejected — we had tried a whole host of fixes for\n                    the problem, but so far, nothing was working.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    After Ian left, I went out and laid on the couch in the hallway.\n                    I wanted a break from my code, and, as often happens, this gave\n                    my mind a chance to approach the problem from a different angle.\n                    I realized that we had several parts working independently,\n                    and that there seemed to be no reason why we shouldn’t be able\n                    to combine these to get a functioning visualizer. I went back to\n                    our workroom, grabbed my laptop, and  sequestered myself in a side\n                    office to make one last attempt at fixing my code.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I pulled up two different, partially working versions of the code. I began\n                    by commenting things out, section by section, trying to figure out what\n                    was breaking my visualizer. Finally, around 2:45, I commented out a small\n                    “if statement”, and suddenly the visualizer worked! It seems that we had\n                    left some code from a previous fix in our new version, and that it had\n                    been breaking everything else. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about\n                    getting my visualizer to work. I had been pretty bummed about the idea of\n                    giving up on this aspect of my project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/the-code-that-broke-my-visualizer-blur.png\" alt=\"The code that was breaking my visualizer\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The offending code</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    Fixing that issue completed my prototype build. I spent the next few hours\n                    adding additional styling, creating a kanban board for build 2, and cleaning\n                    up my code before finally heading out for the holiday weekend!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Thursday</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I have a pretty large extended family in the Central Kentucky area, so\n                    everyone converged on my parents house for a Thanksgiving feast!

I mostly worked on some small features,\n                    and planned out what major features I would start tackling on Monday. Some of\n                    the features that I added: fixing the polling bounce issue, adding controls\n                    for manipulating the visualizer, and figuring out how to set an EQ range.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Final Project: Week 2 Reflection</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I wanted to end this blog post with a few things that I have leaned so\n                    far while working on this project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The low hanging fruit would be the new technologies that I have on boarded:{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\" title=\"Tone.js Homepage\">Tone.js</a> and{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://ptsjs.org/\" title=\"Pts.js Homepage\">Pts.js</a>. While learning specific frameworks and libraries is\n                important, as a beginner developer, the important lessons that I think I\n                have learned are project management and pragmatic problem solving skills.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This was the first project where we have designed everything from the\n                    ground up. My initial MVP designated story (task) difficulty using a\n                    point system. A one point story was easy, while an eight point story\n                    could be really really hard. Once I started coding, I found that many\n                    tasks had unexpected components that made them harder than expected.\n                    Within a few days of working on my project, I had to start “pruning”\n                    my stories — prioritizing the most essential stories, and reassigning\n                    point values once I realized the full magnitude of each task.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I have also learned some new strategies for dealing with problems as they\n                        arise. When importing an element (for example, <code>PtsCanvas</code>), you\n                    can right click in{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" title=\"VSCode Website\">VSCode</a> and\n                select “go to definition” to find out how that component is defined. Reading\n                the meaning behind these higher level abstractions can really help you figure\n                out what is going wrong and why.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A second strategy that I learned was to build test code, something much\n                    simpler than the project you are working on. This test code’s only job\n                    is to test out a key piece of functionality which you do not yet understand.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A third technique that I learned is to compare my code to examples used\n                    in the package documentation. When I was struggling to get Pts.js to work,\n                    I looked up some of their example projects that were doing something\n                    similar (sound frequency analyzation). I went through their code line\n                    by line, commenting things out and changing variable values to get a\n                    better understanding of what code controls what aspect of the project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    And finally, a fourth problem solving technique that I used was to go to\n                    others for help. When asking an instructor or classmate, I would write\n                    down what my specific problem was, make a list of what I have done to\n                    try to solve it, and list out what my theories are regarding why the code\n                    does not work. I found that this helped them better understand my problem,\n                    and quickly orient themselves in my code.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I’m hoping to use these new project management and problem solving skills\n                    in my future software endeavors!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek11;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek12() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    Demo day!

The stress levels in the room seemed\n                    noticeably lower than at the end of week 11. At the end of week 11, many of us were still trying\n                    to implement new stories, and the time crunch was bearing down on us. By Monday of week 12, if\n                    we had not yet started a new story, it was likely that that story would now be pushed to a future\n                    sprint. We were now in the process of polishing up our code and making small improvements.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Most of my major stories got wrapped up the previous Friday. The final major story that I was\n                    attempting to implement was a timer function to kick inactive users out of the queue. I got\n                    about halfway done Monday evening before determining that this was unlikely to get done this\n                    sprint, and added it to my features list for next sprint!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    On Tuesday, I set about tackling my Google Cloud hosting problem. For some reason, Google Cloud\n                    did not like the fact that I used both React and Laravel in one project file. After attempting to\n                    debug this with both Justin and Ian, and with time now running dangerously low, I decided that this\n                    build would have to be run locally, and went about the process of hosting my app from my IP address.\n                    Once I got my site hosted locally\n                    (I implemented it fully sometime Tuesday afternoon), I spent my remaining time testing for bugs\n                    and bringing my code up to production standards.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Demo Day Prep</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Our code freeze was at 10:30am Wednesday morning. Now that I had a demo-able project, I set about\n                        writing a blog post for the week and a <a>README</a> for MPM<sup>2</sup>. I then began\n                    drafting my speech for our two-minute introduction presentations. We did several rehearsals — and\n                    critiques — on Wednesday, and a final dress rehearsal on Thursday morning.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Demo Day</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around 10am, we went down and began setting up our booths. I borrowed some external speakers to\n                    play my\n                    synth sounds, and set up an external monitor for the visuals. I found that, although the app\n                    worked locally\n                    and could be run on a user's phone, it was much more stable on desktop versions. As such, Ian\n                    offered to let\n                    me use his laptop to demo the user experience. On Ian's laptop, users could control the various\n                    synth and visual parameters. On my laptop, I had the source code and MySQL database, as\n                    well as my blog\n                    and LinkedIn pages available for users to peruse. I also set up a contact sheet, laid out some resumes, and\n                    posted my name on the table!\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/demo-day-booth.JPG\" alt=\"MPM2 Demo Day Booth\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Ready for Demo Day!</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around 11:30am, the guests started to arrive! We then mingled and talked with friends and family\n                    for\n                    about 30 minutes. Waiting was making me a little anxious, so I was glad when the instructors\n                    began\n                    their presentations around noon. Nick, Justin, and Ian all talked about the Bootcamp and\n                    our final project development process. After they were done speaking, we each had two minutes to\n                    introduce ourselves and to talk about our projects.\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- Carousel Images --> */}\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/demo-day-instructors.JPG\"\n                            alt=\"Justin, Ian, and Josh\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Lead instructor Justin talking about\n                                        the Bootcamp</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/demo-day-audience-2.jpg\"\n                            alt=\"Demo Day Audience\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">The audience — ready for some Demo Day\n                                        fun!</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/demo-day-robbie-presenting.jpg\"\n                            alt=\"My presentation speech\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Explaining MPM2</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <p>\n                    For my presentation, I talked about my background in{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"spotify:album:3izLLRwlc66KiLs3M6P4wk\" title=\"My single 'Wake'\">music making</a>, my intention of\n                    combining this passion with our tech stack for the final project, and finally how\n                        MPM<sup>2</sup> worked.\n                    I even had two jokes planned for my speech — one about how I cut off all my long hair, and\n                    another about\n                    the value of my project (none — it's art).

This meant that I usually got a fairly solid grip on a concept before\n                    adding something new. Working with Tommy, I had to jump into the middle of a\n                    project and I felt as though I was confused as to what was going on\n                    outside of the small scope of my current work.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    To help remedy this, I spent some time last weekend and this week reading\n                    through the Swift documentation and taking notes.

I was really excited\n                    to build something that I could run on my phone. While web development seemed\n                    challenging, there are online website builders and it didn’t seem impossible\n                    to build my own website, even prior to the Bootcamp. App development,\n                    however, had a certain magical quality and I was really excited to build\n                    something that I could run on my phone.\n                    </p>\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\" style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\" }}>\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/calculator-demo.gif\" alt=\"A demo gif of my calculator app\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">My calculator app!</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                    We built a calculator app in the Bootcamp, so this project mostly involved\n                    refactoring my old code over from JavaScript to Swift. Even so, there were\n                    some problems\n                        (mostly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself\" title=\"DRY Code — Wikipedia page\">WET code</a>)\nthat I was able to address in this build.\nI was also pretty happy with the retro color scheme.

Named parameters have\n                                    an argument name that comes first. In the above example, this means that when we call <code>funcName</code> we would need to\n                                    specify the name of each parameter we give it: <code>funcName(argumentName: \"Some value\")</code>. The{\" \"}\n                                <code>parameterName</code> is the value used within the body of the function.\n                                </li>\n                            <li>\n                                After the argument and parameter names you see <code>: String</code>. This is another interesting difference\n                                between Swift and JavaScript. You declare variable types using a semicolon followed by the variable type (things like:{\" \"}\n                                <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>Array</code>, or <code>Any</code>).\n            Here we are declaring that the parameter type supplied will be a String.\n                                </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Finally, after the parameters, we see <code>-> String</code>. This specifies a return type. Functions in Swift\n                                can either be Void or return a single value (of which you could combine several values in a single, compound{\" \"}\n                                <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple\" title=\"Tuple — Wikipedia page\">tuple</a>).

Sometimes I think that design\n                    is looked at as the least important of a developer’s skill set.\n                    Backend is typically seen as more complex, and is usually more highly\n                    compensated. Kuang and Fabricant’s book has had me thinking a lot\n                    this month about the importance of design.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The first thing that I found interesting is the story of{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.\" title=\"Apple, Inc Wikipedia\">Apple</a>.\n                    When Apple began its rise to world dominance, I was still too young to be\n                    a heavy computer user. It’s interesting because when I say “too young”\n                    I was actually much older than the age that many children today surf\n                    the web and watch Jake Paul vlogs. The difference is that before Apple\n                    ushered in the age of user friendly devices, children did not use computers\n                    at nearly the rate they do today. Since I was too young to really use a\n                    computer before Apple became prominent, I did not really understand the\n                    context in which Apple began making hardware.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Before Apple, computers were powerful machines that required specialized\n                    knowledge to use. They came with large, densely worded manuals, and despite\n                    the fact that they could do many tasks better than old methods, their\n                    difficulty of use prevented them from being nearly as prevalent as they\n                    are today. Apple’s designers strove to create user interfaces that lessened\n                    the difficulty of taking a task from an idea in your head --> to the\n                    interaction with the computer --> to the desired result. The iPhone and\n                    the ability to physically touch and drag objects around the screen really\n                    embodies this ease of use. To move down a page you simply drag down, just\n                    as you would drag a piece of physical paper across a table if you wanted to\n                    move it downward. Apple helped revolutionize the world of intuitive computing.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One aspect that “User Friendly” has had me thinking about is the difference between\n                    UI and UX. UI and UX are often grouped together as UI/UX, and it wasn’t until recently\n                    that I started thinking about their differences. UI stands for User Interface, and I\n                    think this is what most people think about when they imagine a designer. UI includes\n                    aspects such as color, layout, and aesthetics. UX stands for User Experience, and may\n                    have very little to do with visual design, but rather with how a human interacts with\n                    an object. UX involves thinking about how a designer can help make using a device as\n                    intuitive as possible. UI and UX can be completely independent of each other. Imagine\n                    you download an app with great UI: the colors are beautiful, there are tons of animations\n                    when you interact with the screen, etc. Now imagine that you start interacting with the\n                    app. You want to move an object from the bottom to the top of the screen. Instinctively,\n                    you click and drag. Nothing happens. Finally, you realize if you tap on the object, a\n                    menu appears. In that menu,  hidden at the bottom of a scrollable list of 20 options,\n                    you finally see “Move”. You tap “Move”, and are taken to a new screen where you are\n                    asked to enter X and Y coordinates for the desired location of the object. Talk about\n                    bad UX. I’m sure you can also imagine a case when an app with minimal User Interface,\n                    could have a great, intuitive User Experience.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    For more information on UI and UX, I recommend reading{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1107939/user-friendly/9780753556641.html\" title=\"User Friendly Book Publisher's Page\">“User Friendly”</a>,\n                        or to check out some of Apple’s documentation on{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/\" title=\"Apple's Human Interface Guidelines\">Human Design Interface Guidelines</a>.\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default February2020;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction March2020() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Monthly Update</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I realized that my blog post from February didn’t include a Monthly Update.\n                    Before diving into creating an image cache, I wanted to provide an update\n                    on some things I have done in February and March:\n                </p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        Play Catan (and lose)\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Spend a lot of money on yummy French food for Valentine’s day\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Participate in\n                        a <a href=\"https://anv4.artbyform.com/\" title=\"FORM's Website\">24-hour song making competition</a>.\n                        My song was 1 of 37 tracks included on the album.

We left for Colorado on March 11th. When we left, there\n                    were 1,215 cases in the US, which was worrisome, but we didn't think it was enough at that point\n                    to cancel our travel plans. Instead, we took lots of hand sanitizer and wipes, and we were careful on\n                    the plane not to touch our faces and to wash our hands regularly.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    During our week in Colorado, things continued to look worse and worse. We woke up in the\n                    hotel room to the news of canceled sporting events, and watched throughout the week as the DOW\n                    dropped nearly 3,000 points. We planned on skiing\n                    for 2-3 days (packing our lunch, washing our hands often). The first day, there were no reports of COVID-19\n                    in Breckenridge. On the second day, we noticed that employees were sanitizing tables and that ski lifts were now\n                    loading only members of the same party. On our third day out there, after the first confirmed cases on COVID-19 were\n                    reported on the mountain, the Governor stepped in and shut down all the ski slopes.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/ski-trip-lift-policy.JPG\" alt=\"COVID-19 Precautions\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Day 2: Breckenridge institutes a \"Load Related Parties Only\" policy for the ski lifts.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                On a positive note, we really enjoyed seeing William! The 2 days that we got on the slopes\n                were awesome. Anna continues to improve as a skier! On only her fourth cumulative ski day,\n                she managed to go down a blue run! After spending the weekend in Breckenridge, we spent a few\n                more days in Denver, mostly in William's apartment due to concerns with COVID-19.\n\n                <br /> <br />\n\n                {/* <!-- Carousel Images --> */}\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/ski-trip-1.JPG\"\n                            alt=\"Anna Skiing\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Anna is a quick learner!

My app is only about halfway done, \n                    but I wanted to talk about an image cache feature that I \n                    built this week that I thought seemed really important.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In computing, a cache is a collection of data, stored by the \n                    computer so that future requests for that data can be served \n                    quickly. Here is a possible real world analogy: imagine you \n                    are a police sketch artist. You spend several hours drawing \n                    suspects 1, 2, and 3. The next day, your star witness \n                    eliminates drawings of suspects 1 and 2. Do you throw away \n                    drawings 1 and 2 immediately? Perhaps not. If your star \n                    witness changes their mind, you would have to redraw suspects \n                    1 and 2. This would result in a lot of duplicated work. \n                    Rather, it might be better to store these drawings, at least \n                    for a little while, as the case progresses.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Computer programs do something similar. In my Instagram app, \n                    I have a “home feed” of images from users that I follow. When \n                    I scroll from top to bottom, any image that I scroll past, the app has to load \n                    from <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\" title=\"Firebase Website\">Firebase</a>. \n                    When I scroll past an image, should my app forget the data from that image? If \n                    so, when I scroll back to the top of my feed, my app will have to load all of \n                    those images again. That’s a lot of extra work. Instead, my app can cache those \n                    previously loaded images, storing them out of sight in case they are needed \n                    again in the future.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\" style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\" }}>\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/robbie-instagram-clone-home-feed.png\" alt=\"Instagram Clone Home Feed\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The \"Home Feed\" of my Instagram app clone.</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                    There are two main reasons why caching is helpful. First, it \n                    decreases data usage. If someone has a limited data plan, they \n                    don’t want to burn through data just to see photos their device \n                    should already have loaded. Second, it increases speed. If a user's \n                    device is on a relatively slow internet connection, they may have \n                    to wait for each file to load. Once the file is loaded, it would be \n                    wasteful for the device to delete the file if there is a reasonable \n                    expectation that the user will access it again soon.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">My Image Cache Code</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Below is an image of my image cache code:\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/image-cache-code.png\" alt=\"Image Cache Code\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The code for fetching images from Firebase — includes a cache function (lines 21-24).</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    This code is for a <code>CustomImageView</code> class, an \n                    extension of <code>UIImageView</code>. This custom class allows \n                    me to call a <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> method on an image view, that loads \n                    an image from Firebase and sets the image view image equal to that loaded image. \n                    This abstracts away a lot of repetitive code as I have to load images \n                    from Firebase in several places throughout my Instagram app.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    On line 11 I declare an <code>imageCache</code> variable. \n                    Since <code>imageCache</code> is declared outside \n                    of our custom class, it is available throughout our entire code \n                    base. <code>imageCache</code> is a dictionary of key-value pairs, \n                    with the keys being Strings and the values being \n                    of the type <code>UIImage</code>. The way key-value pairs work in a dictionary is similar \n                    to how a real world, paper dictionary works: a word (the key) is paired with a \n                    definition (the value). For example, lets say you created a dictionary called colors: \n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"text-center\">\n                    <code>colors[\"blue\": \"the color of water\", \"red\": \"the color of fire\"]</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    If you called <code>colors[\"blue\"]</code> the output would be: <code>\"the color of water\"</code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Our code works just like this! The block of code from lines 30 \n                    to 46 fetches our images from Firebase. After fetching the images, \n                    it adds the fetched image to the <code>imageCache</code> dictionary \n                    using the key value of the image's download url String. Let's say for example that \n                    the first image we download has a download url of <code>\"xyz\"</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The next time <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> is called, it \n                    will run a test on line 21 to see if the image we are about to download is \n                    already in our cache. If this is a new image (for example, if we have scrolled \n                    down on our feed) with a download url of <code>abc</code>, then the check of \n                    <code>imageCache[\"abc\"]</code> will return <code>nil</code> and the code continues \n                    on to lines 26 and below — fetching this new image from Firebase and adding it \n                    to our cache.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Lets say that we now scroll back up on our feed. <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> is \n                    called again, and on line 21, we check to see if the first image with a download \n                    url of <code>\"xyz\"</code> is in our cache. Since it is indeed in our image, we \n                    now enter our conditional block on line 22, setting the <code>CustomImageView</code>'s image \n                    to the cached image (ie. using the cached image as the image to display in the app). \n                    On line 23, we then <code>return</code> out of the <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> method, \n                    never allowing our code to reach lines 30-46 where we would have made an unnecessary \n                    Firebase call.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Hopefully I have managed to explain why using caches are useful, and \n                    shown a simple example of how to implement one in your code!\n                </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\n\n            </article >\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default March2020;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction April2020() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Monthly Update</h3>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Highlights from April: Anna borrowed her Dad’s lawn mower.\n                    We are now proud lawn mowers!\n                </p>\n\n                <video width=\"100%\" controls>\n                    <source src=\"/blogAssets/video/anna-mowing-the-lawn.MOV\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n                    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n                </video>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Anna's job as a Healthcare Technician has gotten significantly more\n                    stressful as she has gotten pulled to a COVID-19 floor for the past\n                    3 shifts.

The course took a long time to work through —\n                    over 16 hours of content, and since I paused often to code along or look things up,\n                    I’m sure that time was at least doubled. Below is a video walkthrough of my completed app.\n                    I can’t recommend LBTA enough.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n                    <iframe className=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcsI42rxDQs\" title=\"Instagram Clone Demo Video\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    My next project was to create an app — something relatively\n                    original — and attempt to take it from conception all the way\n                    through to being published on the app store.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Step 1 of course was handing over the $99 to join the Apple developer program...\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    With my wallet now slightly lighter, it was time to decide\n                    what kind of app I wanted to create. I really like photography,\n                    and since I had already learned how to create a custom camera\n                    interface in the LBTA Instagram course, I decided I would try to\n                    make a glitch camera app.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I wanted the interface to be simple. The user loads the app,\n                    opening with the camera already activated. The only control\n                    is the shutter button. Once the user takes a photo, they can\n                    save it or delete it and try again. As an additional bit of\n                    flair, I wanted the camera shutter button to animate in and out,\n                    to make the app feel a bit more alive. The graphic for the camera\n                    shutter was made from a photo taken by the app.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure border\" style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\", margin: \"auto\" }}>\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/appAssets/img/glch-saved-message.PNG\" alt=\"Generated with the Glch App\" />\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    There are no controls that the user can manipulate. The effect\n                    that the user gets is random and unexpected.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Building the effects was where things started to get more challenging.\n                    I used Core Image filters to create the distorted effects. These often\n                    had their parameters maxed out far beyond their intended ranges, or\n                    were chained one after another to create interesting effects. Currently,\n                    the app has 14 different effects.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Creating a Core Image Filter</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Creating a Core Image filter is actually fairly simple.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In the Glch app, I am using UIImageViews. Step one is\n                    to convert the <code>UIImageView.image</code> into\n                    a <code>cgImage</code> (Core Graphics Image). In the example \n                    below, <code>imageView</code> is a parameter containing \n                    the <code>UIImageView</code> that I have passed into my function:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}guard let cgImage = imageView.image?.cgImage else &#123;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}print(\"Failed to create CG Image.\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}return UIImage()<br />\n                        {\"    \"}&#125;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}let ciImage = CIImage(cgImage: cgImage)<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    Now that I have my <code>cgImage</code>, I can begin creating image \n                    filters:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}let filter = CIFilter(name: \"CIExposureAdjust\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: \"inputImage\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter?.setValue(NSNumber(1.5), forKey: \"inputEV\")<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    The <code>CIFilter</code> allows you to create a filter by setting \n                    its <code>\"name\"</code> property. You can find a list of all of the \n                    available <code>CIFilters</code> in \n                    the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/\">Apple Documentation</a>. \n                    I next pass the <code>cgImage</code> into the filter by setting the filter \n                    value, with a key of <cdoe>\"inputImage\"</cdoe>. Finally, I adjust the filter \n                    parameter by again setting the filter, but this time with a key value \n                    of <code>\"inputEV\"</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    From here, one option would be to continue to chain together more <code>CGFilters</code>. To \n                    do this you simply add another filter, but instead of passing in our \n                    original <code>cgImage</code>, we pass in the output of our first \n                    filter, <code>filter?.outputImage</code>. Example:\n                </p>\n                \n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}let filter2 = CIFilter(name: \"CIColorMonochrome\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter2?.setValue(filter?.outputImage, forKey: \"inputImage\")<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    When you are done chaining together filters, you may now want \n                    to output a <code>UIImage</code>.

The course is really well done\n                    and is incredibly popular, being both the most popular on campus course and the\n                    most popular digital course. The second resource is a list of self-taught CS\n                    resources and a learning roadmap.

A useful way to send a signal through \n                    a computer is using electrical impulses. Impulse off: 0. Impulse on: 1. \n                    A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor\">transistor </a> in \n                    a computer can store billions of these impulses, allowing the computer \n                    to store large amounts of information.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A group of 8 bits is called a byte. When you hear about your computer \n                    having 1 Gigabyte (Gb) of memory, this means that it can store 1 billion \n                    bytes (or 8 billion bits). \n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Since a byte contains 8 bits, it can store values from 0 \n                    (00000000) up to 255 (11111111). Since 8 digits are hard to \n                    read and write, computer scientists often use a Base-16 system \n                    of counting called Hexadecimal, using the digits 0-9 A-F. The is \n                    useful because a byte can now be expressed with just two digits. \n                    To notate Hexadecimal, it is useful to prefix it with 0x:\n                </p>\n\n                <Table>\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Decimal</th>\n                            <th>Binary</th>\n                            <th>Hexadecimal</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">0</th>\n                            <td><code>00000000</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">10</th>\n                            <td><code>00001010</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x0A</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">15</th>\n                            <td><code>00001111</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x0F</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">255</th>\n                            <td><code>11111111</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                    </tbody>\n                </Table>\n\n                <p>\n                    You can begin building text documents and images using binary.\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Text From Binary</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    You create text from binary using a character encoding standard \n                    called <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\">ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</a>.

If you \n                    zoom in enough on a digital image, you will eventually see pixilation, \n                    where the photo starts to look blurry as individual pixels appear. Each \n                    pixel is a single color, which combined with many many other pixels, can \n                    create the illusion of a high definition image. Each pixel on its own though, \n                    can be declared by how much of the primary colors Red, Green, or Blue you \n                    add to it. You can therefore tell a computer to display primary color values \n                    from 0-255 of intensity for each color.\n                </p>\n\n                <Table>\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Red</th>\n                            <th>Green</th>\n                            <th>Blue</th>\n                            <th>Result</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code> (256)</td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code> (0)</td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code> (0)</td>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">Red</th>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code> (256)</td>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code> (256)</td>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code> (256)</td>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">White</th>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code> (0)</td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code> (0)</td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code> (0)</td>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">Black</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </tbody>\n                </Table>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Compiling</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    How does code written in a higher level language like C# get converted \n                    into one’s and zero’s?

This is\n                    something I really enjoyed -- and that I kept at for a few months after the bootcamp (I made monthly\n                    posts until <a href=\"may-2020\">May 2020</a>). I made one more post in <a href=\"may-2021\">May of 2021</a> and have not posted since.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I have a few topics I have been writing about (mostly reviews and summaries of technical books), and\n                    I thought I would start the blog back up! While reviewing my website, I looked at some\n                    old posts and realized that I have missed the personal side of blogging -- sharing small updates\n                    about what has been going on in my life.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    To get the blog back up, I have to do a few things:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Some general maintenance and updates to the website.</li>\n                        <li>Write a few blog posts:</li>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>A post saying that I will be posting again (this post!)</li>\n                            <li>Year in Review posts for 2020, 2021, 2022, and a short post of what has been going on so far in 2023.</li>\n                            <li>A post talking about my \"read more technical books\" goal.</li>\n                            <li>Adding a few already-written reviews/summaries of technical books as posts to this blog.</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <li>\n                            Create a <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/BlogPostParser\">utility script</a> that will parse a text file (blog post) into <abbr title=\"HyperText Markup Language\">HTML</abbr>.\n                            I typically write blog posts in a text editor and then manually format them into HTML.

This is a little bit funny as the lockdowns lasted for several years, and even in 2023 I still sometimes wear a mask in public places.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that was really reassuring during this stressful time was watching governor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear\">Andy Beshear's</a> daily press updates.

At the beginning of the year, I did freelance iOS development on UpWork for a local client. Sometime around March, I landed my first (small) freelance client. During all of this, I was sending out job applications for software jobs. I kept a detailed spreadsheet of my job hunt. Over 7 months (Nov 2019 - May 2020), I applied for 61 jobs. From that, I got 8 interviews. One turned into the UpWork freelance work and then  (finally) in May, I landed a full time tech job! I applied to several companies on multiple occasions (these were separate posting over a period of months). I ended up applying to VetData 4 times and interviewing for 2 roles before finally receiving an offer.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    It took me a while to land in tech. I was originally supposed to graduate from <a href=\"https://www.centre.edu/\">Centre</a> in 2015. I took an extra year to add courses in Music. I spent a few years after graduating working odd jobs and doing a lot of creative work in music, filmmaking, and photography (2016-2019). My parents were always super supportive of this, but I imagine that they must have been worried about what direction my career would take (they never told me this, but I was certainly worried, so I'm guessing everyone around me worried too). After graduating from Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp in December of 2019, my parents knew that I was job hunting but I kept things pretty quiet. After getting my QA offer at VetData, I asked to come over for dinner and surprised them with my offer letter! Below is a picture of us celebrating.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My job at VetData was remote (eventually there was an option to go into the Lexington office, but people rarely worked in person). I have included a picture of my remote work setup, taken the weekend before my first day.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/getting-a-job.JPG\" alt=\"VetData offer letter\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">My parents and I celebrating my real job!</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/first-day-of-work.JPG\" alt=\"Remote work setup\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">My remote work setup</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Summer</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Onboarding onto a new role remotely was a little challenging. The first few days were both exciting and exhausting. The all day Zoom calls were a little draining but I was really excited about the new job.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A perk of working from home during the summer was that I spent my lunch breaks going for walks or relaxing in the backyard. That summer, I listened to a podcast featuring <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant\">Naval</a>. Naval talked about meditation (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856?lang=en\">a different Naval thread on meditation</a>). From that podcast, my understanding was that meditation didn't need to be guided and that it could be as simple as sitting somewhere and letting your mind wander -- ie just doing nothing.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The rational behind this had to do with the inputs and outputs of our brain. We are constantly feeding our brain new information: we check our phones when we are bored, we listen to music in the car, we read books or watch TV at home. This is more stimulation and information then our caveman brain ever had. With all of this input, when to we give ourselves time to process and make sense of this information? Naval compared meditation to an email inbox -- we have all of these thoughts to process and as we spend time \"doing nothing\", we begin to process this backlog of thoughts. \n                </p>\n                    \n                <p>\n                    All of that is to say is that when I spent some time hanging out in the backyard, I expected to be bored. Instead, I was surprised to find that I always had stuff to thing about.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/backyard-meditation.JPG\" alt=\"Robbie in the backyard\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Lunch break in the backyard</ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    We also took advantage of the summer weather and threw a dinner party! Yes that is our kitchen table on the back porch -- this was a season of life without much furniture and we had no dedicated outdoor pieces. It looks like Anna made us some yummy ramen. We did a lot of cooking that summer. I was really into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqJQ_cXSat0KIAVfIfKkVA\">J.

My grandfather (Bob's) mom (Jane) was into family history and had many boxes as pictures, documents, and written notes. That day, we took those boxes out and looked through them. I am also very interested in family history and I was asked if I wanted to start going through those boxes. I felt a little overwhelmed by the amount in the boxes, and thought that I would need to dedicate a time to come over and talk to my grandfather about everything in there. I declined to spend a lot of time that day looking over stuff and I really wish I had. He seemed so healthy then and I didn't know that he would be gone soon.\n                </p>\n                \n                <p>\n                    Living so close, I saw my grandfather a lot so I don't have many regrets and am actually pretty grateful for the time we had together.

Due to Covid, we decided to do a \"drive by\" party. Everyone came by in their cars, we wished them a Happy Holiday, and gave them some Christmas treats. It was probably a good thing that we did our party remote because on Christmas day, we all started to lose our sense of taste and smell. A few days later, we tested positive for Covid. We were lucky that our symptoms were mostly mild (Dad was the sickest with flu-like symptoms). In a way, it meant that we all spent a few more days celebrating the holidays together.\n                </p>\n                \n                <p>\n                    Anna worked over the holidays and was not around us enough to catch Covid.

I have about 77 minutes left in my 20’s. I’ve been dreading turning 30 all year -- maybe even for several years.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/about-to-turn-30.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie on the front porch\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Writing a blog post, a little cold out</ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Somewhat surprisingly, a thing that Mike Posner says has been on my mind. I've always thought of Mike Posner as one of many many American pop stars -- His music is good but I never really admired him personally.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Then I found his YouTube channel.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In 2019, Posner <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXeZNXdu-gs\">walked across the United States</a>. Walked. It took him almost a year. In 2021, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfgV-ZCnYw\">climbed Mount Everest</a>. He summited 71 mountains around the world in order to prepare.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Walking across the country is hard. Summiting mount Everest is hard. Hard work that someone like Mike Posner probably doesn't need to do. I don't know his financial situation, but his videos show sold out shows and he has millions of subscribers on his YouTube channel. I imagine his life could be easier than climbing mountains and walking across continents. I imagine it could be private jets and pool parties in vegas; expensive houses (maybe a few) and cars a non-car guy like me wouldn't recognize. It seems like Mike Posner has a choice between something easy and something hard -- something pretty good or something truly fulfilling, and he has chosen to do the hard work.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In my own life, I feel like I often have a choice between what is easy and comfortable and what is fulfilling and meaningful. This weekend, I was thinking about these tradeoffs:\n                <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            I love being up early -- I hate waking up early; I have trouble falling asleep early.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            I love being outside at night -- In the evening, the couch is more comfortable and the TV has a lot of appeal.\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n\n                    I often choose the extra sleep over the sunrise and a Netflix show over looking at the stars. Sometimes I let the weather be an excuse: It is March and we've only had a few days of nice weather so far this year. Tonight, it is 37°. I am writing this on my front porch -- I have sweats and a heavy jacket on. I'm a little uncomfortable, but am actually having a really good time.\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    My list of excuses is pretty small. I have a flexible job — if I want to do something in the morning, I can get to work later and stay late. If I want to travel and work remote, I can travel and work remote. Financially, I can afford a few additional expenses here and there.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    It is one thing to know that you don’t have the time, flexibility, or resources to do things that make your life more fulfilling. It is a little more depressing to know that you chose creature comforts over a meaningful life. Perhaps the meaningful life that I am looking for was described by Henry David Thoreau 170 years ago:\n                </p>\n\n                <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n                    <p class=\"text-muted\">\n                        <small>\n                            \"I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.\"\n                        </small>\n                    </p>\n                    <footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">Henry David Thoreau, <cite title=\"Walden\">Walden</cite></footer>\n                </blockquote>\n\n                <p>\n                    TV and social media feel like the <i>not life</i> Thoreau was talking about. Sometimes even books feel like the <i>not life</i>. Life feels like pre-dawn walks and sitting in your backyard under the stars. Life feels like playing board games with your friends or using your body to hike, run, climb, or play a sport. Life feels like sitting still, doing nothing -- doing nothing, which is such an un-American, non-activity: You can't write end-of-year lists of the best \"nothing\" to do it your city. You can't sell it or put it on billboards. But sometimes the <i>nothing</i> feels like \"[putting] to rout\" all of that <i>not life</i> that HDT wrote about 130 years before the social media and the internet.\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Going back to that thing that I said Mike Posner said: he ends <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2CwZ1UTSSA\">several of his videos</a> with a lyric:\n                </p>\n\n                <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n                    <p class=\"text-muted\">\n                        <small>\n                            \"Beginnings always hide themselves in endings.”\n                        </small>\n                    </p>\n                </blockquote>\n\n                <p>\n                    As my 20’s draw to a close (I now have 63 minutes left), I am looking forward to making small changes that choose the meaningful over the easy.

I've had a really great day celebrating my new decade with friends and family. Anna was out the door early to get us bagels and doughnuts. At work and at the gym, I got to make lots of lame jokes about how I'm turing into an old man (typically, the people older then me were the ones who found these jokes the least amusing). After the gym (and 30 birthday burpees), Anna and I met up with my parents and Grandma Emily at <a href=\"https://www.italx.com/\">ItalX</a> for a really nice dinner (I got the Gnudi di Zucca -- it was delicious). After dinner, we came back to our house for dessert: pecan pie from <a href=\"https://missyspieshop.com/\">Missy's</a> (it was also very good; after this week, I would be okay if I never had sugar again). William and his roommates videocalled in for a verse of Happy Birthday.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/birthday-breakfast.jpg\" alt=\"Anna and bagels\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Anna got us breakfast :)</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/birthday-dinner.jpg\" alt=\"Dinner at ItalX\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Family dinner</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/birthday-candles.jpg\" alt=\"30 candles\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Too old for 30 individual candles</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/birthday-group.JPG\" alt=\"Family celebration\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Me, Emily, Dad, Mom, and Anna</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default TheHardWorkOfLivingAGoodLife;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction MyBookshelf() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/bookshelf.jpg\" alt=\"Some of my technical books\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">My collection of read (left) and unread (right) technical books.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Here is a list of computer science and software development resources I have used:\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            {/* <span className=\"text-success\"> */}\n                            <b>Web Developer Bootcamp</b> (Awesome Inc)\n                            {/* </span> */}\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    4-month coding bootcamp that I graduated from in the Fall of 2019.\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.awesomeinc.org/bootcamp\">Bootcamp Website</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                        </li>\n\n                        <li>\n                            <b>CS 50</b> (Harvard)\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    A very interesting and completely approachable introduction to some fundamental computer science topics.

He stayed in our guest bedroom and while there he asked about the bookshelf that lines one side of the room. I has some technical books on it, and he asked if I had really read all of them.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The answer was, absolutely not.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/xmas-2022.JPEG\" alt=\"Family christmas\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">From when my brother came to visit.

The way I see it, the career benefit to a good technical book far outweighs the $25-50 that most of them cost.

The author, Charles Petzold, is a Microsoft MVP and was named one of seven <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Pioneers\">Windows Pioneers</a> for his contributions to technical writing.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    What makes code really interesting is that Petzold starts from the ground floor: he begins with a story of children using flashlights to communicate between houses to illustrate how binary information (flashlight on or off) can be used to communicate anything. He covers the history of how information is encoded and transmitted: counting systems (binary, decimal, hex), encodings (braille, morse code), and how electronic circuitry is used to transmit information (telegraph relays, logic gates, and eventually chips and computer architectures). Petzold works to keep things simple, making a point of explaining how to build basic computer components using technology that has existed for over a hundred years: explaining how you could build basic logic gates and computer chips using only telegraph relays. Code was written in 1999, and finishes with sections on operating systems, low and high level languages and the graphical revolution – some of which feels a little dated nearly 25 years later. Code is a great overview of the history of information encoding and computer engineering.\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default CodeBookReview;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction CleanArchitectureBookReview() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b><u>Rating</u></b>:\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    &#11088; &#11088; &#11088; &#11088; &#9733;\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b><u>Review</u></b>:\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <i>Note: These reviews are not meant to be an objective or comprehensive review, but rather just a short summary of my key takeaways.</i>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <i>This review was completed on 2/9/23 but only made its way onto my site on 4/16/23.</i>\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Parts 1 and 2 of Clean Architecture covered programing paradigms (structured, object-oriented and functional programing) and SOLID principles.

If you have not encountered SOLID before, then I think these initial section will be of interest.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b>: Group together the things that change at the same rate and for the same reason.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>O: Open Closed Principle (OCP)</b>: Classes should be closed to modification and open to extension.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</b>: Classes that inherit from the same interface should be swappable.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</b>: Don’t make classes implement interface members that they don't need.

The book makes a point that an architect is someone who codes, and often is one of the best coders on the team. After all, an architect should be in the trenches having to deal with the problems that good architecture attempts to solve.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One key thing that an architect does is to delay decisions as long as possible. I know, this makes it sound like an architect is just a major procrastinator. What this actually means is that you want your software to remain “soft”; You want it to be adaptable. Requirements change over time and building software is in itself an act of discovery. If you commit to decisions early on, then when things change, you won’t be able to change with them. Deferring decisions means writing code that is loosely coupled – code that doesn’t care what database or framework is used and data that doesn’t care how it is entered or displayed. Decisions can be deferred indefinitely in well architected code.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/clean-architecture.jpg\" alt=\"Dependencies being pointed in the right direction\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Dependencies pointed in the right direction. Lower level components depending on higher level components.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    How does a good architect keep components from becoming tightly coupled? By making sure that higher level modules never depend on lower level modules.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    What are higher and lower level modules? Robert Martin defines lower level modules as components that are closer to the I/O of the system. GUI’s, frameworks, databases all exist close to the inputs and outputs. On the opposite end, the business rules – the logic that governs how the company either makes money or saves money should have absolutely no dependencies. The business logic should not care at all about how it is implemented.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    It can be easy to violate this principle. If you were to write a simple application that calculated sales tax per state, you might write your business logic to run an equation on the sales tax for each state:\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        tax = [state tax rate] * [sale price]\n                    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Where will you get the sales tax of each state? From your database of course! So you create a reference to you database service directly in your business logic. Now your business logic depends directly on your data control layer.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        tax = [query database for state tax rate] * [sale price]\n                    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When your database logic changes, there is a good chance that you will break your business logic. By creating a dependency on your database, your dependency tree looks like this:\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        [database layer] &lt;- [business logic]\n                        The arrow shows that your business logic depends on your database layer.\n                    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    You can fix this by inverting your dependencies. Our business logic will expose an interface that the database layer will have to conform to.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        [database layer : IDataAccess] -> [IDataAccess]\n                    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[business logic]\n                    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Now anything that wants to interact with our business logic has to take on a dependency on our business logic. If the business logic has to make a change to its data access API – to the contract it has made with its dependencies – this change will likely ripple down to all components that depend on it. This is desirable because high level changes are likely to occur less often and be more important than frequent, trivial changes in lower level components.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Databases, frameworks, the web are all implementation details that your higher level components should know nothing about. Keeping your higher level components ignorant or your lower level components allows your software to remain soft and mailable.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The book ends with a warning about over-engineering: boundaries between components are expensive to create and expensive to maintain. Take into account the experience of your team and the requirements of your project. Don’t over-engineer a solution.

Faults can be hardware (typically random and uncorrelated. Although hardware can be generally very reliable, even low failure rates add up when you are dealing with large amounts of hardware – example: hard disks are reported to have a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 10 to 50 years. In a large storage cluster with 10,000 disks, you should expect an average of one failure per day), software (bugs are systematic and typically harder to deal with), or human (human error – a study of large internet service providers found that most outages were caused by operator error). Fault-tolerance techniques can hid certain types of faults from the end user.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Reducing human errors:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Make it easy to do the right thing (well designed APIs and admin UIs)</li><li>Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes (sandbox and dev/testing environments separated from pod)</li><li>Test thoroughly at all levels</li><li>Allow quick rollback from human errors (easy to rollback config changes)</li><li>Setup detailed and clear monitoring (telemetry) so that you can see problems coming</li><li>Implement good management practices and training</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Scalability</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The system should have reasonable ways of dealing with growth.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The goal of scalability is to keep performance good even when load increases. To talk about this, we first need ways to describe load and performance quantitatively. Numbers that we use for describing load are called “load parameters”. Examples: requests per second to a web server, ratio of read to writes in a database, number of simultaneously active users, hit rate on a cache. Depending on your needs, you may care more about average load or bottlenecks.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Typically, percentiles are better than average because the average (mean) is not what most users experience – instead the median (halfway) is often better. Percentiles: the median user (50th percentile, or p50) and also the outliers (p95, p99, p999). Higher percentiles are known as tail latencies\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    SLA (service level agreements) talk in these terms.

Although relational database are very popular, some data still isn't modeled well this way, so two types of nonrelational (NoSQL) data models have been developed:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Document DBs: The data coming in is self-contained documents and relationships between documents is rare.</li><li>Graph DBs: Opposite direction – target situation is where anything is potentially related to anything else. Graph DBs consist of a series of vertexes (data) and edges (connections between data).</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    All three – document, relational, and graph – are widely used today.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Document and graph DBs don't enforce a schema – not to say there isn't one, just not required. This is the difference between explicit schema (enforced on write – if you don’t match the schema, your write will fail) and implicit (schema is assumed on read).\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Query Languages</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Imperative languages – many programing languages are imperative – give a list of steps to achieve a goal. Ie. make a sandwich: get out bread loaf, slice two slices, get out peanut butter…\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Declarative languages: you just give the desired result. SQL is declarative: you give a pattern (I want all records where Location is “USA”) and the database engine optimizes and determines the steps needed to reach that goal. This hides complex implementation details from the user. Declarative languages often lend themselves to parallel execution via only giving a requested outcome. This means that optimization can be made behind the scenes. This is good as modern computers are getting faster by added more cores (parallel processing power) rather than running higher clock speeds.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>MapReduce</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    MapReduce is a programming model for processing large amount of data in bulk across many machines.

In the style of functional programming, the map and reduce functions must be pure: they only use the data passed in as input, no additional internal database calls, and they must not have any side effects. Map gathers the data you need and reduce does processing on that data.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    More details on MapReduce can be found in chapter 10 summary.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Some interesting research is ongoing on other data models:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            Genome data: often needed to perform sequence-similarity searches which means taking a really long string (representing a DNA molecule) and matching it against a large database of strings that are similar but not identical.

Adding new data to the end of a text file is fast, making database writes very efficient! Unfortunately, reads are slow, as the database must be scanned from beginning to end looking for requested data – a O(n) time operation.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    An optimization we can make is to add indexes to our database. Indexes are metadata added to the data that tells us where to efficiently find it. This could be a simple hashtable. To do this, we would give each piece of data a key, and the matching value is an offset in our file of where to find the data.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Example</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        Data File:\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        [location 0] (key: 123, value: dog) (key: 456, value: fish)\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        [location 12] (key: 789, value: cat) (key: 000, value: mouse)\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        Hashtable:\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        key: 123, value: 0\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        …\n    </code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <code>\n                        Key 789, value: 12\n\n\t</code>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    When we query for a key with an index on it, our hash function quickly gives us the offset of where to find out data, and we have optimized to O(1) reads!\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    You can add multiple indexes to a dataset. Each additional index adds processing time to your write operations – you are making a tradeoff between efficient writes and efficient reads. This could be a good time to think about the use case of your database. If your application expected to have frequent writes but few reads, you might want to optimize for writes (this includes optimizations beyond our simple indexing optimization). Likewise, a database receiving frequent reads could consider optimizing for that use case.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Continuing with our append-only log implementation, adding a new data entry is as simple as appending to the end of the file. To update data, we append a new entry, and on reads, we take only the most recent entry matching a given key – old data is still in the database but the user only sees the most recent entry. We also overwrite any indexes that point to old data and we make sure that it points to the most recent entry. To delete data, we append a special entry that saying the something to the effect of: “this item has been deleted”. Reads for that data will now give the same result as if the entry did not exist in the database (ie returning no result). These special “delete” entries are sometimes known as tombstones.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    As we continue to add data to our append-only log, our log will likely grow too large given enough use. To combat this, we can implement a process called compaction. Compaction will scan through the database and delete all duplicate entries except for the most recent one. For tombstone entries, all entries for that data could be deleted. Compaction keeps our read only log at a manageable size.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    We have now built a simple and efficient read and write database. A few details to round out our database implementation:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Indexes are often kept in memory to improve performance. If the database crashes, these would be lost. You could rescan the database when you restart the database but this could be time intensive. A better solution would be to occasionally save a snapshot of the indexes that can be used to rebuild the indexes quickly if the database crashes.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Database files are often kept in a non-human readable, binary format to improve performance.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Crashes can lead to a partially written entry. To avoid database corruption, the database should include checksums that show that certain entries are corrupted. These entries remain in the log but are ignored by the system. When compaction runs, they are removed from the database.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    It is common to implement multiple read threads and a single write thread, to avoid complications around concurrent writes.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Update in place databases</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    An alternative to the append-only log is the update in place implementation.

Rather than keeping a full index of entry in the database, we can keep a much sparser data structure while still maintaining constant time lookups. The way this works is similar to a physical dictionary that keeps the starting word at the top of the page. We can keep a list of the starting words for each page, and once we get close enough to the word we are looking for (ie the correct page) we can quickly scan through that page manually. In practice, this looks like one entry for every kilobyte of data.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/SSTable.png\" alt=\"SSTables\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>How to construct and maintain an SSTable</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When a new write comes in, keep it in an in-memory sorted data structure like a balanced tree (sometimes referred to as the memtable). When the memtable exceeds a certain size (usually a few MBs), write it to disk as a new segment. Since the memtable is already sorted, we can just write it as is. While writing the old memtable, writes can continue on a new memtable. In order to perform a read, first check the memtable, then the segments on disk from newest to oldest. From time to time, run compaction on the segments as a background task. For crash safety, keep an append-only log of all writes in the memtable. If a crash occurs, all the writes are not lost and con be recovered from the log. When the memtable is committed to disk, discard the append only log.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    The algorithm we have described for creating a SSTable is essentially a Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM Tree). LSM-Trees can be slow to lookup data as checking first a memtable and then every segment in storage just to determine that some piece of data does not exist is very inefficient. A bloom filter – a memory efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a dataset – can be helpful here.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    LSM-Trees are gaining acceptance but are still not the most common indexing structure – the most common indexing structure is still the binary tree (B-Tree) which is used in almost all relational databases and many non-relation databases.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>B-Trees</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    B-Trees break data down into fixed page sizes (usually 4KB). The page contains either references to more pages or data (a page with data is called a “leaf page”). The number of references to child pages is called a branching factor. This is a very efficient way to index. Most databases only contain 3 or 4 levels of binary tree branches. A 4-level index with 4kb pages and a branching factor of 500 can store up to 250TB!\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    B-Trees often use a write ahead log (WAL) – an append-only log that is kept in case of a database crash.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/BTree.png\" alt=\"BTree\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>A random note from the chapter that I wanted to include</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Fuzzy indexes: fuzzy indexes are used to include index matches that are close but not exact, like misspellings.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>In-memory databases</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The reasons to save data to disk in a database is: storage is cheaper than memory (RAM) and disk storage is stable (not lost on power failure).

In these databases, users are sending really high volumes of reads and writes to small sections of data. Ie viewing and creating social media posts, viewing and purchasing items on online retails. Each user action touches only a small subset of data but there are many users creating many queries so the bottleneck is disk seek time as a large volume of these small queries run.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>OLAP: Online Analytics Processing</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Some databases are business facing – they are used for business information and decision making.  Businesses need to draw conclusions from large volumes of data. This is different from OLTP with small, frequent changes (involving both reads and writes) to relatively infrequent read operations over very large volumes of data. These large queries can be performance intensive and could degrade the OLTP database performance.  This is especially bad as user facing systems like OLTP typically need to be performant, where business analysts would typically tolerate relatively longer processing times. Because of these different use cases, OLAP database solutions are often different and entirely separate from OLTP.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/ETL.png\" alt=\"\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    A typical system could involve several different user facing applications, each with its own OLTP database. In the above image, customers, warehouse workers, and truck drivers are all working with their own apps. An ETL process is run on these databases: extracting the data from each, transforming it into a format that is useful for the OLAP database, and then loading it into the OLAP database. This could be done in several large batches (perhaps once per day) or streamed into the OLAP as new data arrives. The OLAP data is held in a data warehouse which is optimized for OLAP queries.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/Fact-Table.png\" alt=\"\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Many data warehouses use a star schema – a central “fact” table with branches off of it in the shape of a star. Each fact represents a thing that happened: a purchase, a click, etc. This contains both attributes (values) and foreign key references to dimension tables (the branches off of the central star). Each fact is an event, each dimension is a who, what, when, where, why. Fact tables can be big (10s of PBs for big enterprise like Apple, Walmart, eBay).\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Column oriented storage</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Facts can be very large and often we will query against a large volume of facts but only need a few pieces of information from each fact. Pulling up each fact (which could contain hundreds of pieces of information) only to select a small subset of that fact’s information, is very inefficient. A solution to this is column oriented storage.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Instead of storing facts as one unit, you store each attribute of a fact as its own data entry. This means that if there is a “purchase date” attribute, rather than having each purchase data as a part of a fact, you group all of the purchase dates on their own. Now when you need to query all purchase dates, you only have to look in one place.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This is often implemented by adding all data in the same order. So fact #12354 could have the 1005th purchase-date and the 1005th total-tax-amount. Ordering is very important in column oriented storage.\n</p>\n\n\n                <br />\n                <hr />\n                <br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Chapter 4: Encoding and Evolution</h3>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Chapter 1 introduced the concept of “evolvability”: we should aim to build systems that make it easy to adapt to change.

Only one schema is enforced at any time. Schema-on-read (schemaless) databases don’t enforce a schema so there is a mixture of old and new data within the database.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When you make changes, you may not want to roll out everything all at once as this creates more risk. Likewise, when updates are on user devices, you can’t typically control when they will be updated. All of this means that you will have old and new versions of the software running at the same time, and therefore old and new data coming into and being read out of you application.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    To ensure your application continues to run smoothly, you need:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>Backward compatibility</b>: Newer code can read data that was written by older code.</li><li><b>Forward compatibility</b>: Older code can read data that was written by newer code.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Backward compatibility is typically not hard to achieve as you have the benefit of knowing what that older code looks like when you write the newer code. Forward compatibility is a little but trickier and often involves your application code ignoring additions or changes made by newer versions of the code.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Formats for Encoding Data</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Programs typically work with two representation of data:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>In memory</b>: objects, structs, lists, arrays, etc. that are typically accessed via pointers.</li><li><b>Sequence-of-byte representations</b>: when you write data to a file or send it over a network, you have to encode it to some sort of self-contained sequence of bytes. Since a pointer would not make sense to another process (as they do not share memory), this looks quite different from the data structures you typically use. </li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    To work with these two different representations, we need a translation process. Translating from in-memory to a byte sequence is called encoding (also called: serialization, marshalling) and the reverse is called decoding (parsing, deserialization, unmarshalling).\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Language Specific Encodings</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Most languages come with built in encoding. Unfortunately, these built in encoders come with several problems: you are now tightly coupled to one programming language (and if you want backwards computability, then you are tightly coupled forever!), they can come with security concerns, and many of them are notoriously slow.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>JSON, XML, Binary Variants</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Standardized encodings can be used by many programming languages. JSON, XML, and CSV have the benefit of being human readable. All 3 have some issues around encoding numbers (the difference between a number and a string that happens to contain all numbers is ambiguous in XML and CSV; issues with large numbers), lack of support for binary strings, and schema issues (optional in XML and JSON, not supported in CSV). Despite these flaws, these are widely used, standardized formats and the flaws are greatly outweighed by the difficulty it takes to get different organizations to agree on a standard.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    For internal use, you don’t need the overhead or baggage that comes with standardized encodings.

Rather then including keys, you can include a schema version and perhaps afield tag (as used in Thrift’s BinaryProtocol). Avro is even more compact and includes no filed tags, instead requiring values to be in the same order as they appear in the schema.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Enforcing schemas also has the benefit of being a form of documentation – one that you are required to update, unlike the stuff that ends up in places like your ReadMe.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Dataflows</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <u>Databases</u>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Writes encode the data and reads decode it. You can think of writes as sending a message to your future self – and your future self better believe in backwards compatibility if they want to be able to read that message in the future. As mentioned earlier, you will likely have older and newer versions of your code running at once. You will need backwards and forwards compatibility to be able to function smoothly. There are additional issues: A newer version writes some data that includes a new field (we will call it X), an older version then accesses this data entry and updates it. The desired outcome would be for X to not get overwritten, even though the older version of the code doesn’t even know that an X field exists. This is often handled at the database level but it can be good to be aware of this (and consider handling it) at the application code level as well.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Code will often change, while there could be data in your database that is years old: data outlives code.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <u>Services – REST and RPC</u>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Data needs to be communicated over a network. The most common arrangement is to have two roles: <b>clients</b> and <b>servers</b>. Servers expose an API over the network and clients connect and make requests to that server. The API exposed by the server is known as a <b>service</b>. While databases allow for arbitrary queries based on a query language, services restrict consumers to only what is allowed via the API.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Servers can even be clients to other servers: in service-oriented architecture (SOA) (or microservices architecture), you decompose your application into smaller services. This might include servers that call other servers during the lifecycle of a request.  A benefit or microservices is to make different parts of the application independently deployable, allowing for rapid change. Typically, one team would own its own microservice.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When HTTP is used as the underlying protocol for talking to a service, it is called a web service (though they are not only used on the web). There are two popular approaches to web services: <b>REST</b> and <b>SOAP</b>. REST is not a protocol but rather a design philosophy built on HTTP: simple data formats, URLs for identifying resources, authentication, content type negotiation. An API designed according to REST principles is RESTful.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    SOAP is XML-based protocol for web requests and aims to be independent of HTTP. The API of a SOAP web service is described in an XML-based language called the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). WSDL is not designed to be human readable.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    REST is more popular for cross-organization communication and microservices. Although it is still used at many large enterprises, it has fallen out of favor at many smaller companies.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has been around since the 1970s. RPC tries to make a request to a remote network service look the same as calling a function in your programming language. Although convenient at first, this is fundamentally flawed as making a network request is very different from making a local function call:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>A local function call is predictable (fails or succeeds), a network call is unpredictable: the request or response may be lost or delayed; the remote machine may be slow or unavailable.</li><li>Retrying a failed network call may actually be the same as rerunning it if the first request succeeded but the response was lost.</li><li>Latency is widely variable on a network call while local calls are typically similar in runtime.</li><li>You need to encode parameters for a network call, while a local call can accept pointers.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    REST does not try to hide the fact that it is a network protocol. REST is the predominant style for public APIs. RPC frameworks are often used between services owned by the same organization.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    gRPC is a RPC implementation using Protocol Buffers.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <u>Message-Passing</u>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    REST and RPC:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One process sends a request and another tries to respond as quickly as possible.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Databases:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One process writes data and another process might read it sometime in the future.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Asynchronous message passing systems are somewhere in between RPC and databases. A message is delivered to a client, typically with low latency (similar to RPC). The message does not go directly to the server, but rather to a message broker (also called: message queue, or message-oriented middleware) (similar to a database).\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Benefits of a message broker:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Can help with load if messages are arriving too fast</li><li>Can redeliver messages if server has crashed.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Typically a message is sent to a queue or topic, and those messages are delivered to all subscribers of that topic.

Popular algorithms include:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Single-leader</li><li>Multi-leader</li><li>Leaderless replication.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Single Leader Replication</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Each node that stores a copy of the data is called a <b>replica</b>. With each write, we need to ensure that each replica receives those changes to the data. The most common solution is called <b>leader-based replication</b> (aka active/passive, master-slave replication). Here’s how it works:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ol><li>One replica is designated as the <b>leader</b> (master, primary). New writes are directed to the leader which first updates its local copy of the data.</li><li>The other replicas are known as followers (read replicas, slaves, secondaries, hot standbys). Whenever the leader writes new data to its local storage, it also sends the data change to all of its followers via a <b>replication log</b> or change stream. Each follower takes those changes and applies them to their local storage in the same order as the leader.</li><li>When a client wants to read from the database, they can query the leader or any of its followers.</li></ol>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Follower updates can be <b>synchronous</b> or <b>asynchronous</b>. Synchronous means that when a write comes in the following happens:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>The leader updates its local storage and sends out a change stream</li><li>The followers must then all successfully update their local storage and send back a response before the leader will report to the client that the write was successful. </li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This has the advantage that all copies of the data are always up to date. The major disadvantage is that a single node going down can grind the whole system to a stop (a follower not being able to acknowledge an write prevents writes from succeeding). For this reason, many systems that are synchronous really just mean that at least one follower is synchronous. If that follower goes down, another replica is made synchronous. This is sometimes known as <b>semi-synchronous</b>. This ensures that if the leader goes down, at least one other replica has the most recent writes.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Often though, leader-based replication is completely asynchronous. If the leader fails and is not recoverable, and has not yet been replicated, this means that writes are lost even if they have been confirmed to the client. This means that a write is not guaranteed to be <b>durable</b>, even if it has been confirmed to the client. For example, a user performs an action that updates a page. The user expects that change to be durable (i.e. to persist). Due to an outage on the leader node, that update is lost and when the user checks again, their changes seem to have disappeared. The advantage of asynchronous replication is that the leader can continue to process writes even if many or all of the followers have fallen behind or gone down.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    When choosing between synchronous and asynchronous replication, you have to take into consideration <b>replication lag</b>. If you are reading from a follower, you might get data that is not as up to date as data in the leader or some of the other followers. There are several situations that should be considered when discussing replication lag:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>Read-after-write consistency</b>: Users should always see the data they submitted themselves.<ul><li>If the user submits a write that goes to the leader and then attempts to read the data they just submitted, the read request might go to a follower node that does not yet have that data. This will make it appear to the user that data is lost.</li><li>It might be that if the user refreshes the page, their data may be there. For some use cases, this is enough. For others, users may not be pleased with their data appearing to be gone.</li><li>Solutions: If this data is on a user’s personal profile, a simple solution would be to have all personal profile reads served from the leader. Another option is to track the last user update time and if there has been an update, to make all user reads from leader for one minute.</li></ul></li><li><b>Monotonic reads</b>: After a user has seen the data at one point in time, they shouldn’t later see the data from some earlier point in time.<ul><li>This could occur when the user makes two subsequent read requests: the first sees updated data and the second sees data that has not yet been fully updated from the leader. This will give the appearance of moving back in time.</li><li>To solve this, you can require that each client pick a follower and always read from that follower (if that follower fails, the client will be reassigned). This does not mean that the client will always see the most up-to-date date, but it does ensure that the data moves in a linear time direction.</li></ul></li><li><b>Consistent prefix reads</b>: Users should see the data in a state that makes causal sense: for example, only seeing a reply after first seeing the question.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Adding a new follower:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Snapshot the leaders data</li><li>Copy the snapshot to the new replica</li><li>Connect the follower to the leader and request changes since the snapshot occurred</li><li>Process the backlog of changes and come online.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Handling Node Outages</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Nodes can go down unexpectedly or for planned maintenance.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Follower failure: Followers that go down and come back online can recover easily via <b>catch-up recovery</b>. When the node recovers from crash, it will request all changes that it missed and apply those to its local data.</li><li>Leader failure: Leader failure is a bit trickier and is addressed via <b>failover</b>. When the leader fails, a follower needs to be promoted to be the new leader. Then, all of the clients need to be reconfigured to point to the new leader and all of the followers need to consume changes from the new leader.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Detailed failover steps:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ol><li><b>Determine the leader has failed</b>: No foolproof way to detect a failure so often just use a simple timeout.</li><li><b>Choose a new leader</b>: A new leader can be chosen through an election (chosen by majority of remaining nodes) or appointed by a previously elected controller node. The best candidate is usually the node with the most up to date data changes from the old leader as this will minimize data loss. Getting all nodes to agree on a new leader is a <b>consensus problem</b>.</li><li><b>Reconfigure the system to use the new leader</b>: Clients now send write requests to the new leader. If the old leader comes back online, it might believe that it is still the leader. The system needs to ensure that the old leader becomes a follower and recognizes the new leader.</li></ol>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    There are many things that can go wrong with failover:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>If asynchronous replication is used, and the old leader had some unreplicated writes when it went down, what should happen to those writes? The most common solution is that they should be discarded (which reduces durability of the system’s data).</li><li>In certain fault scenarios, it is possible for two nodes to believe that they are the leader (a leader appears down because it has exceeded its timeout. A new leader is selected. The old leader recovers and comes back online). This is a situation known as <b>split brain</b>. If both nodes accept writes and there is no process for resolving conflicts, then this can lead to lost or corrupted data. As a safety catch, some systems have a means to shutdown a node if two are detected as being leaders.</li><li>There are tradeoffs when seeing a leader timeout. Too long of a timeout causes unnecessary downtime: nodes may be waiting on a leader that will not recover. Too short of a timeout causes too many failovers: leader nodes may routinely experience high load or slow networks and will violate there timeout when they are still online and healthy.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    All of these issues are in fact the fundamental problems of distributed systems: node failures, unreliable networks, and tradeoffs around replication consistency, durability, availability, and latency.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Replication Logs</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A common way of doing replication logs is <b>write ahead logs (WAL)</b>: The leader creates a write ahead log of all the data changes and sends that log out to its followers to run.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Multi-leader Replication</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Single-leader replication is a common choice because it is fairly easy to reason about and understand. Multi-leader and leaderless replication can be more robust in the presence of faults, at the cost of being more difficult to reason about and only providing weak consistency guarantees.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Multi-leader replication is where multiple nodes are designated as leaders, and send updates to followers as well as other leaders.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    A major downside of single leader replication is that if you can’t access the leader for writes, everything goes down – this makes your leader a single point of failure. It rarely makes sense to use multileader within a single data center because the added complexity outweighs the benefits. If you have multiple data centers, having a leader in each can be a good idea.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/Multi-leader-replication.png\" alt=\"Multi-leader replication\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Offline Leaders</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One use case for multileader replication is clients that need to work offline.

Although popular, LWW is dangerously prone to data loss. Another approach is to keep conflicts and prompt the user to resolve them via application code (the application could display a prompt to the user such as: “there is a conflict in the data, choose which result to keep”). Converging towards a consistent state means that the data will eventually get updated across all replicas.

The client sends writes to as many of the nodes as it can. One node is offline so it does not receive the update. When a client reads a value, it attempts to read from as many nodes as possible. The previously offline node has come online so we now have one node with stale data and two nodes with current data. The read checks for a quorum – for a certain (often majority) of node having the same value. In this case, the quorum shows our new value. This is what is returns to the client.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When writing, the client will also check for a write quorum – a threshold of successful writes that must be present for the write to be considered successful.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    The quorum value for reads and writes is configurable. Sometimes it is a simple majority for both reads and writes. One possible configuration is to require that all nodes confirm a write for it to be successful. You then only need to check a single node for reads. This makes reads very fast and allows many nodes to go down before reads are affected. This works well for datasets with low writes and high reads. The tradeoff is that a single failed node prevents writes.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    When nodes come online, they need to self repair in order to get caught up on what they missed.

When this happens, it updates those stale values to match its quorum. This approach works well for values that are read often. Data that is not frequently read could remain stale for extended periods of time.</li><li><b>Anti-entropy process</b>: A background process that runs and checks for and  subsequently updates stale data.</li></ol>\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Sloppy quorums ask the question: if enough nodes are down that you can’t form a quorum, should you return an error or accept the write onto the nodes that are still online. By still accepting writes, you increase availability as you can continue to accept writes when a high number of nodes are offline or unavailable. The downside is that you lose the guarantee that your reads will always have up to date values.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Dealing with concurrency</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Concurrency does not mean that two events occurred at exactly the same time but rather that they were unaware of each other.

This requires choosing a partitioning schema that fits your data. You will likely need to rebalance partitions when nodes are added or removed from the cluster.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Two approaches for partitioning:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>Key range partitioning</b>: Keys are sorted and a partition owns all keys from a minimum to a maximum. This is similar to how an encyclopedia is split into separate books by alphabetic range.</li><ul><li>Efficient range quires are possible, but you run the risk of hot spots if the application often access keys that are close together in the sorted order.</li></ul><li><b>Hash partitioning</b>: A hash function is applied to each key and each partition owns a range of hashes.</li><ul><li>This method destroys the ordering of keys, making range quires inefficient but distributing load evenly.</li></ul></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Datasets that are not partitioned in a way that avoids hot spots are said to be <b>skewed</b>.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Even if using hashing, it may still not be possible to avoid hot spots. If a given piece of data is quired more often than other data, then this will still result in a hotspot. A common example of this is celebrity profiles on social media applications. The celebrity profile might have millions of followers compared to hundreds or thousands of followers for the average user. When the celerity makes a post, there will now be a large number of writes and reads to the same key. Most data systems are not able to automatically account for hot keys like this, and this sort of load balancing will have to be handled via application code or manual database administration.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b><u>Secondary Indexes</u></b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Secondary indexes are commonly used to quickly search databases. These present problems in partitioned databases as secondary indexes do not map neatly between partitions. There are two common approaches to secondary indexes in partitioned datasets:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>Document partitioned indexes (local indexes)</b>: the secondary indexes are stored in the same partition as the primary key and value.

This means that when a new car is added with the color: red, only the secondary index on that partition needs to be updated. This makes writes efficient. When reading from the database for red cars, the query will now have to check all partitions for secondary indexes on red cars. This makes writes inefficient.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li><b>Term-partitioned indexes (global indexes)</b>: Secondary indexes are partitioned separately, using the indexed values.

This makes writes more challenging, are you may have a car that is silver colored but that has been assigned to partition 0. After writing to partition 0, the database must now search through partitions until it finds the one that stores the color silver. There may even be additional secondary indexes stored on other partitions. Writes are inefficient on global indexes.\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This approach does make reads efficient. If searching for red cars, you only need to access partition 0 which stores the red car secondary indexes. You now know which keys the other red cars are paired with an can quickly access the appropriate partitions.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b>Rebalancing Partitions</b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Over time, changes occur to the database:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    <ul><li>Query throughput increases, so you add more CPUs to handle the load.</li><li>The dataset size increases, so you add more disks and RAM to store it.</li><li>A machine fails, and other machines need to take over that machine's responsibilities.</li></ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    All of these changes require that data and requests be moved from one node to another.

This means that if you add a node, it can steal a few partitions from each of the other nodes. You can account for mismatched hardware by giving more partitions to more powerful machines. Only entire partitions are moved between nodes. Typically, the number of partitions does not change, so you should initially create enough partitions that can accommodate growth.\n            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <li>\n                            <b>Dynamic partitioning</b>:\n        </li>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                Key range partitioned databases do not work well with a fixed number of partitions. When you create your database, you have to decide where to create key range boundaries. If you get these wrong initially (which you likely will, as you can’t predict what data will be ingested into your data system), then you will have some partitions with high volumes of data and some that might be empty. Dynamic partitioning is often used in key range partitioned databases for this reason.\n            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Dynamic partitioning works by splitting partitions into two partitions when it grows past a configurable size.

To address this, some databases offer <b>pre-splitting</b> where your empty database starts with some initial partitioning. This requires you to have a pretty good knowledge of where to divide you partition key boundaries.\n            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </ul>\n\n            Rebalancing can be automatic or manual, with a gradient of options in between. Some databases will suggest partition rebalances, but require administrative approval to proceed. Automatic rebalancing can reduce operational costs but can cause performance degradations as rebalancing is expensive and without user oversight, could be done too frequently or at inopportune times. In general, having a human in the loop for rebalancing can prevent operational surprises.\n</p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    <b><u>Request Routing</u></b>:\n</p>\n\n                <p>\n                    When a client wants to make a request, how does it know which node to connect to?

A transaction is a way to group several reads and writes into a logic unit. Either the entire operation succeeds (<b>commit</b>) or fails (<b>abort rollback</b>) and can be retried again safely. There are no partial failures. By using transactions, the application is free to ignore certain error scenarios (these are called <b>safety guarantees</b>). \n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNot every application needs transactions and sometimes there are reasons to abandon them completely such as higher performance or availability, or if an application is simple enough to not need the added complexity.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tThe safety guarantees provided by transactions are said the be <b>ACID</b>:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Atomicity</b>: Atomic refers to something that cannot be broken down further. This means that a transaction cannot be broken down – it cannot partially complete or partially fail. It either works fully (commit) or fails completely (abort).</li><li><b>Consistency</b>: Consistency means that you have certain statements about your data that must always be true (<b>invariants</b>). For example: in accounting systems, credits and debits must always be balanced. Consistency is more a property of the application than the database. Joe Hellerstein remarked that “C” was tossed in to make the acronym work.</li><li><b>Isolation</b>: Isolation means that concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other – they cannot step on each other’s toes.</li><li><b>Durability</b>: Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, any data written will not be forgotten. In a distributed database, this means that the data must be replicated to a certain number of nodes before being deemed successful. Perfect durability is not possible – there is always a chance that all of your nodes will be destroyed at once. There are only risk-reduction techniques.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tACID databases are based on the philosophy: if the database is in danger of violating its guarantee of atomicity, isolation or durability, it would rather abandon the transaction entirely that allow it to remain half finished.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn some ways, “ACID compliant” has become more of a marketing term. Systems that are not ACID are sometimes referred to as <b>BASE</b>: <b>B</b>asically <b>A</b>vailable, <b>S</b>oft state, and <b>E</b>ventual consistency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAlthough retrying failed transactions is simple and effective, it can cause problems:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>If the transaction actually succeeded but the network failed when the server tried to acknowledge the successful commit to the client, the client will think it failed and will try to run the transaction again resulting in duplicated transactions.</li><li>If the error is due to overload, retrying will make things worse.</li><li>It is only worth retrying on transient errors as a permeant error will continue to fail each time.</li><li>If the transaction has side effects outside of the database, those side effects may happen even if the transaction is aborted. Example: you wouldn’t want to send an email each time you try to run the transaction to update the mailbox count.</li><li>If the client process fails while retrying, the data it is trying to write will be lost.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Weak Isolation Levels</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf two transactions don’t touch the same data, they can be safely run in parallel. Concurrency issues (race conditions) only come into play when one transaction reads data that is concurrently modified by another transaction or when two transactions try to modify the same data at the same time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tConcurrency bugs are hard to find by testing as they are only triggered when you get very unlucky with timing. Such timing issues might occur very rarely and can be difficult to reproduce.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Serializable isolation</b> means that the database guarantees that transactions have the same effect as if they were run serially (one after the other). Serializable isolation has a performance cost and many databases don’t want to pay this price. It is common for systems to use weaker levels of isolation that protect against some but not all concurrency issues.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe most basic level of transaction isolation is <b>read committed</b> which makes two guarantees:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ol><li>When reading from the database, you will only see data that has been committed (no dirty reads)</li><li>When writing to the database, you will only overwrite data that has been committed (no dirty writes)</li></ol>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"text-center\">\n\t<figure className=\"figure\">\n\t\t<img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/dirty-reads.png\" alt=\"Dirty reads\" />\n\t\t<figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tRead committed prevent dirty writes.

A common implementation is for the database to prevent dirty reads by using row-level locks: when a transaction wants to modify a particular object (row or document) it acquires a lock on that object. It must hold the lock until the transaction is completed or aborted. This approach does not work well in practice as a long running write can force many other transactions to wait, even if they are read only and not attempting to do any writing. A better approach is for the database to remember the old value for any locked object, and to return the old value until the lock is released.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Read skew</b> is when you read data being updated while a transaction is running. For example, one transaction updates two objects and you read the database when one object has updated and the other has not. This creates a <b>nonrepeatable read</b>: reading the database again will produce a different (and likely more accurate) result. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRead skew is considered acceptable in read committed isolation – in most cases, the user will be okay with reloading the page and seeing the correct result.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are a few instances where read skew can cause a problem:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Backups</b>: Backups over large datasets may take several hours, during which time writes will continue to be made. This could cause the backup to contain read skew and restoring from the backup will make those inconstancies permanent.</li><li><b>Analytical queries and integrity checks</b>: Large queries that scan over the database will return nonsensical results if they observe parts of the database at different points in time.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSnapshot isolation is the most common solution to this problem as this provides backups and analytical queries with a consistent snapshot of the database.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tImplementing snapshot isolation involves requiring locks for writes but not reads. This leads to a key principle of snapshot isolation: <b>readers never block writers, and writers never block readers</b>. The database will keep several committed versions of the objects, known as multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"text-center\">\n\t<figure className=\"figure\">\n\t\t<img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/snapshot-iso.png\" alt=\"Snapshot isolation\" />\n\t\t<figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Lost Updates</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWhen two transactions write concurrently, this can cause one write to override the other one (sometimes known as <b>clobbering</b>). Writes typically follow a <b>read-modify-write cycle</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere are serval solutions to this problem: atomic write (operations taking an exclusive lock on every read), explicit locking in application code if database atomic reads are not available, automatically detect lost updates and abort the transaction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDistributed database replications make lost writes more challenging as the conflicting writes may be occurring in different datacenters. A common solution is to allow all conflicting writes to survive (known as <b>siblings</b>) and to use application code to resolve these conflicts.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Write Skew and Phantoms</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWrite skew occurs when application code checks multiple objects before making a decision, and then updates one of the objects. While updating one object, the other object gets updated and makes the previous precondition no longer true. One of the best solution is to add a serializable isolation guarantee, as this causes the updates to act as if they were executed one after another. Another, less optimal solution is to use <b>materializing conflicts</b> – you add additional information to lock multiple objects when an update needs to occur.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Serializability</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSerializability is regarded as the strongest level of isolation. Most database provide serializability through one of three methods:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ol><li><b>Executing in serial order</b>. Executing in serial order was not an option for many years, but as RAM has become cheap and OLTP transactions short, running as a single thread can be feasible. If you can make transactions very fast, and the transaction throughput is low enough to execute on a single core, then this can be an effective and simple solution.</li><li><b>Two-phase locking (2PL)</b>: In 2PL, multiple transactions can read an object but if a write is attempted, a lock is acquired. The write must wait for the read to finish, then the write is processed. All reads must wait for the write to finish. Readers do not block each other but a write must wait for reads to finish, write, and then release its lock. 2PL is called two phase locking because all objects in the database have a lock that can either be in shared or exclusive more. If two objects get stuck waiting for each other (<b>deadlock</b>), the database will detect this situation and abort one of the transactions.</li><li><b>Serializable snapshot isolation (SSI)</b>: 2PL does not perform well and Serial Execution does not scale well. Weak isolation levels perform well but are prone to various race conditions. SSI is very promising and relatively new (2008) algorithm. It provides full serializability with only a small performance penalty. 2PL is a <b>pessimistic</b> concurrency control mechanism – things could go wrong so it always acts like they will and protects against them every time. SSI is an <b>optimistic</b> concurrency control mechanism, allowing transactions to proceed unblocked until it is time to commit at which time they are checked for concurrency issues and aborted if issues are found. In most cases, cases where there are not issues, this lack of locking allows for a performance increase.</li></ol>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tSummary of race condition issues:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Dirty reads</b>: One client reads another client's writes before they have been committed.</li><li><b>Dirty writes</b>: One client overwrites another client's writes before they have been committed. Almost all transaction implementations prevent dirty writes.</li><li><b>Read skew</b>: A client sees different parts of the database at different points in time. Snapshot isolation: a client reads the database at a particular point in time.</li><li><b>Lost updates</b>: Two clients concurrently perform a read-modify-write cycle.

Our task as engineers is to build systems that do their jobs in spite of everything going wrong.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tBuggy software can give the appearance that a computer is “having a bad day” but this is almost always the result of software not hardware issues. If a hardware issue occurs (memory corruption, loose connector), the results is usually a <b>total system failure</b>. This is a deliberate choice – a computer is designed to work correctly or not at all – total failure is better than an incorrect result. This is called <b>always-correct computation</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSoftware running on a single machine should be <b>deterministic</b> – it should return the same result each time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn a distributed system, some components could be broken while others may be working fine. These <b>partial failures</b> can cause nondeterministic results. Partial failures and nondeterminism is what makes distributed systems hard to work with.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Cloud Computing and Super Computing</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThere is a spectrum of philosophies of how to build large-scale computing systems:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>High-performance computing (HPC)</b>: Supercomputers with thousands of CPUs typically used for computationally intense scientific tasks such as weather forecasting or molecular dynamics.</li><li><b>Cloud computing</b>: Not very well defined but usually associated with multi-tenet data centers, commodity computers connected over IP networks (Ethernet), elastic/on-demand resource allocation, and metered billing.</li><li>Traditional enterprise data centers lie somewhere in the middle.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSupercomputers will typically save a snapshot of their work to storage from time to time. If a component fails, the entire system will crash. The component can then be replaced and computation resumes from the last checkpoint. Due to this, supercomputers often behave similarly to single machines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMany distributed systems are online – and have users that expect low latency, always-on response times. Taking the entire system down for repairs is not an option. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSupercomputers are built from specialized, reliable hardware. Distributed computing relies on cheap, commodity machines. The bigger a distributed system gets, the more likely it is that among its thousands of nodes, at least one thing is broken and being repairs at all times. If a system can tolerate failed nodes and still keep working as a whole, this can be very useful for operation and maintenance: You can perform a rolling upgrade, restarting one node at a time while the others continue to function. In distributed systems, you must build a reliable system out of unreliable components.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tShared nothing systems are the dominant way of building distributed data systems because they don't require specialized hardware and instead can use commodity computing machines.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe internet and most networks in datacenters (often ethernet) are <b>asynchronous packet networks</b>, meaning that one node can send a message to another node but the network gives no guarantees when it will arrive or if it will arrive at all. If you send a request to a node and don’t receive a reply, it is impossible to known why.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>The request may have been lost (perhaps someone unplugged a network cable).</li><li>Your request may be waiting in a queue (perhaps the network or recipient is overloaded).</li><li>The remote node may have crashed.</li><li>The remote node may have stopped responding (perhaps due to a long running garbage collection) but may start responding later.</li><li>The remote node may have processed your request but the response got lost.</li><li>The remote node may have processed your request but the response has been delayed and will be delivered later.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe usual way of handling these issues is with a <b>timeout</b>. Timeouts still do not tell you if the remote node get your request or not.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Network Faults</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tNetwork problems can be surprisingly common, even in controlled environments like a data center. Even redundant hardware doesn’t guard against human error, which is a major cause of outages. Wild things can happen to the network ranging from bad network config changes to sharks biting undersea internet cables.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHandling network faults doesn't always mean tolerating them – sometimes showing the user an error screen and forcing them to wait for the network to come back online is acceptable. It may make sense to deliberately trigger network problems and test the systems response. This is the idea behind chaos monkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFrom the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering\">chaos engineering</a>:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote class= \"blockquote\">\n  <p class=\"text-muted\">\n    <small>\n      \"While overseeing Netflix's migration to the cloud in 2011 Nora Jones, Casey Rosenthal, and Greg Orzell expanded the discipline while working together at Netflix by setting up a tool that would cause breakdowns in their production environment, the environment used by Netflix customers. The intent was to move from a development model that assumed no breakdowns to a model where breakdowns were considered to be inevitable, driving developers to consider built-in resilience to be an obligation rather than an option\"\n    </ small>\n  </ p>\n</ blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Detecting Faults</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMany systems need to detect faulty nodes:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>A load balancer needs to stop sending requests to a node that is dead.</li><li>In distributed databases with single-leader replication, if the leader fails, one of the followers must be promoted to be the new leader.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tRapid feedback that a node is down is useful (sometimes you can get these from the machine the node was running on), but you can’t count on it. If you want to be sure that a request was successful, you need a positive response from the application itself.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Timeouts and Unbounded Delays</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tHow long should the timeout be? Too long and you cause users to wait for the timeout to elapse. Too short and you may prematurely declare nodes dead that are only delayed. The latter is problematic because the node that timed out but was still alive may process the request. Meanwhile, the application assumes that it is dead and sends the request to a new node, resulting in the request being processed twice.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost networks have unbounded delays – they will try to deliver a packet as quickly as possible, but there is no upper limit on how long this could take.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>TCP vs UDP</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSome latency-sensitive application such as videoconferencing and Voice over IP (VoIP) use <b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b> rather than <b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b>. This is a tradeoff between reliability and variability of delays: UDP does not retransmit lost packets so it does not suffer as much from delays. This is at the expense of lost data. UDP is a good choice in situations where delayed data is worthless. On voice and video calls, there likely isn’t enough time to retransmit the data before it is due to be transmitted over the speaker. Instead, the missing data is just dropped, causing the call to drop for a second or the video to lag. The retry layer is instead transferred to the human: “Could you repeat that please? The sound just cut out for a moment.”\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tOn a public cloud or multi-tenet datacenter, you have no control or insight into how much load other users are putting on the shared network. A <b>noisy neighbor</b> could use a lot of resources, causing performance to degrade for you. Due to this, you may want to continually measure the difference in delays (<b>jitter</b>) and automatically adjust timeouts.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Networks</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tFixed-line telephone networks (non-cellular, non-VoIP) are extremely reliable. When a call is made, the network establishes a <b>circuit</b>: a fixed guaranteed amount of bandwidth allocated for the call. This is because the data requirements are known: a certain amount of bandwidth is needed for audio and audio is transmitted for the entire length of the call.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tInternet traffic is not like this. It is <b>bursty</b>, having varying data sizes. TCP dynamically adapts the rate of data transfer to the available network capacity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnother way to look at this: Since the amount of data needed for a call in known, you can known the maximum bandwidth of a wire – for example: 10,000 calls. The wire is divided up statically with each call receiving the same amount of bandwidth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tBy contrast, the internet shares bandwidth dynamically. Senders push and jostle each other over to wire as quickly as possible and the network switch's decide which packets to send. This approach has the downside of queueing but the advantage of maximum utilization of the wire.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Unreliable Clocks</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe can measure durations (How long did the user spend on the site? Has the request timed out? What is the 99th percentile response time of the service?) and points in time (When was the article published? When does the cache entry expire? What is the timestamp on the log message?). In distributed systems, time is a tricky subject. This is because the communication from A to B travels over an unreliable and unbounded network. In addition, each machine has its own clock that are not perfectly accurate, so each machine has its own notion of time. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is possible to synchronize clocks to some degree. The most common mechanism is <b>Network Time Protocol (NTP)</b> which allows the computer clock to be adjusted according to the time reported by a group of servers. The servers in turn get their time from a more accurate device such as a GPS receiver.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Monotonic vs Time-of-Day Clocks</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTime-of-day clocks report the date and time (also known as <b>wall-clock time</b>). Time-of-day clocks are often synchronized to NTP. Time-of-day clocks can have various oddities such as: if they fall to far out of sync with NTP, they are forcibly set forward or back in time. These jumps make time-of-day clock unsuitable for measuring elapsed time. Historically, time-of-day clocks have coarse grained resolution, moving forward in steps of 10ms on older windows computers. Recent systems have less of an issue with time resolution.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Monotonic</b> clocks are guaranteed to always move forwards. Their actual value is meaningless - it may be the number of nanoseconds since the computer was restarted. It makes no sense to compare the monotonic time between two computers. Monotonic clocks have good resolution and can typically measure time in microseconds.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Clock Synchronization and Accuracy</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>The quartz crystal used in computer clocks is not very accurate: it <b>drifts</b> (runs faster or slower) depending on machine temperature. Google assumes a clock drift of 6ms for machines that are resynced via NTP every 30 seconds and 17 seconds for machines that resynced once per day.</li><li>NTP can only be as accurate as the network delay. In one study, this was a maximum of 35ms.</li><li>NPT servers can sometimes be wrong. There is robustness – NPT clients query several servers and ignore outliers but it is still a little scary to get your time from a stranger on the internet.</li><li>Leap seconds (minutes with 59 or 61 seconds) can crash systems. The best way to handle this is to make the NTP servers “lie” and spread the leap second out over the course of a day (known as <b>smearing</b>).</li><li>In virtual machines, the hardware clock is virtualized. When a CPU core is shared between multiple VMs, each VM is paused for tens of milliseconds while another VM is running. From the application’s point of view, this manifests itself as the clock suddenly jumping forward.</li><li>If you run software on devices you don’t control (i.e. mobile or embedded devices) you probably cannot trust the hardware clock at all. Some users deliberately set their clock to an incorrect time – for example to circumvent timing limitations on games.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIt is possible to achieve very good clock accuracy if you are willing to invest significant resources. For example, MiDID II European regulation for financial institutions requires that high-frequency trading funds synchronize their clocks to within 100 microseconds of UTC, in order to help debug market anomalies such as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crash\">flash crashes</a>” and to help detect market manipulation. Such accuracy can be achieved via GPS receivers, the <b>Precision Time Protocol (PTP)</b>, and careful deployment and monitoring. It requires significant expense and expertise.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Relying on Synchronized Clocks</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf you use software the relies on synchronized clocks, it is essential that you carefully monitor offsets between all machines and declare a node dead if it drifts too far in clock time from the other nodes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tYou may use timestamps to determine the ordering of events. In the following image, the skew between node 1 and 3 is less than 3ms (probably better than you can expect in practice) and yet the ordering of events is wrong. This can cause unexpected situations such as: database writes mysteriously disappearing (a node with a lagging clock is unable to overwrite values previously written by a node with a faster clock because it always looks like its values are coming in <b>before</b> the fast clock node), LWW cannot distinguish writes that occurred sequentially in fast succession.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"text-center\">\n\t<figure className=\"figure\">\n\t\t<img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/time-issues.png\" alt=\"Time issues\" />\n\t\t<figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tClocks can have a confidence interval, which may look something like: we are 95% confidant that it is 10.3 and 10.5 seconds past the minute. Google’s TrueTime API explicitly reports the confidence interval on the local clock, giving you an earliest and latest possible time that it could currently be. You can calculate an uncertainty bound by combining: quartz drift since last sync with NTP server + NPT server’s uncertainty + network round trip time to the server.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Process Pauses</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Garbage Collection</b> stops all running threads known as a <b>\"stop-the-world” pause</b>. Garbage Collection can be known to last for up to several minutes!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tVMs can be <b>suspended</b> (pausing all processes and saving state to disk) and resumed at a later time. This can be for an indefinite period of time, and is sometimes used to migrate the VM to a new host. This can happen at any point during your application execution.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOn end-user devices, execution may also be paused when the user closes the laptop.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tSome software runs in an environment where a failure to respond within a specific time cam cause serious damage: rockets, robots, cars. These are called <b>hard real-time</b> systems. A <b>real-time operating system (RTOS)</b> allow processes to be scheduled with guaranteed CPU time. Libraries must document their worst-case execution times. Garbage collection must be tightly controlled or not used at all.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Knowledge, Truth, and Lies</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSo far in chapter 8, we have looked at how distributed systems differ from programs running on a single computer: there is no shared memory, messages pass through an unreliable network with variable delays. Systems may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and processing pauses. Because of this, a node can never know anything for sure – it can only make guesses based on the messages it receives (or doesn't receive). It can only get information from other nodes by exchanging messages with them and if the other node does not respond, it cannot know if it is a network or a node issue.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>The Truth is defined by the majority</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA node cannot trust its own judgement of a situation. For example: it may be receiving messages and processing them, but all of its responses are being lost. It thinks it is operating correctly while the rest of the system thinks it is in a failed state. To solve this, distributed algorithms rely on a <b>quorum</b> – a minimum number of voting nodes that reduces the dependency on a single node. Most commonly, the quorum is an absolute majority of more than half the nodes. This prevents conflicting quorum votes (cannot have multiple greater-than-half majorities).\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Fencing</b>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"text-center\">\n\t<figure className=\"figure\">\n\t\t<img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2023/fencing.png\" alt=\"Fencing\" />\n\t\t<figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\"></ figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n</div>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Fencing</b> tokens are used to make locks safe in a distributed system. Without a fencing token in the above image, when client 1 resumes after GC, it thinks it still has a valid lock and would attempt to write to the Storage database, creating a duplicate write. With the ever increasing fencing token, an older write cannot be performed. The lock service serves a lock with an ever increasing fencing token and writes with lower tokens are not accepted.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Byzantine Faults</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIn this book, we assume that nodes are <b>unreliable but honest</b>. I.e. that a node would not deliberately send writes with fake fencing tokens. Distributed systems become harder if there is a risk that nodes “lie” (send arbitrary faulty or corrupted messages). <b>Byzantine faults</b> are where nodes behavior is no longer honest and they send corrupted data or intentionally lie (possibly lying at a human request). Examples include:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>In aerospace, data in memory or CPU can be corrupted by radiation. Flight control systems must be byzantine fault tolerant.</li><li>In a system with multiple participants, some organizations may attempt to cheat or defraud others. In such situations, it may not be safe to trust messages from other nodes as they may have been sent with malicious intent. An example is peer-to-peer blockchain technology as a way to get mutually untrusting parties to agree on transaction states.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost byzantine fault systems require a supermajority of more than 2/3rds for a quorum. Although full byzantine fault tolerance is expensive and likely not practical for must systems, there are still some safeguards you can implement:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>Checksums for corrupted network packets at the application level (though these are usually caught by TCP and UDP).</li><li>Sanitizing input from users of a publicly accessible application.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>System Model and Reality</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA <b>system model</b> is an abstraction that describes what things an algorithm may assume.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTiming assumptions:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Synchronous Model</b>: Assumes bounded network delay, bounded process pauses, and bounded clock error. This does not mean that these timing issues do not occur, just that there is an upward limit on how long they are. This is not a realistic model for most systems.</li><li><b>Partially Synchronous Model</b>: Behaves like a synchronous model most of the time but occasionally violates the upper bound. This is realistic for must systems as it assumes that things usually work, but is prepared for when they don’t.</li><li><b>Asynchronous  Model</b>: An algorithm is not allowed to make timing assumptions and does not even have a clock. This is a very restrictive model.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tNode failure models:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Crash-stop faults</b>: Assumes a node can only fail one way, by crashing. A node that crashes never comes back.</li><li><b>Crash-recovery faults</b>: Nodes may fail at any time and possibly recover later. Nodes are assumed to have stable storage and volatile memory that is lost on crash. This is a commonly used model.</li><li><b>Byzantine (arbitrary) faults</b>: Nodes may do absolutely anything, including trying to trick and deceive other nodes.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMost distributed systems use the partially synchronous and crash-recovery models.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Correctness of an algorithm</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo describe what it means for an algorithm to be <b>correct</b>, we must describe its <b>properties</b>. An algorithm is correct in some system model if it always satisfies the properties in all situations than may occur in that system model.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li><b>Safety and Liveness</b>: <b>Liveness</b> properties often include the word “eventually” (eventual consistency is one). <b>Safety</b> is “<b>nothing bad happens</b>”, liveness is “<b>something good eventually happens</b>”. Safety properties must never be violated while liveness properties can have caveats like: only require a response if a majority of the nodes eventually recover or if the network comes back online.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\t<b>Chapter Summary</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tA wide range of problems can occur in distributed systems:\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<ul><li>When you try to send a packet over the network, it may be lost or arbitrarily delayed. Likewise, the response may be lost or delayed. So if you don’t get a reply, you don’t know if the message went through.</li><li>A node’s clock may be significantly out of sync with other nodes (despite your best efforts to set up NTP). It may suddenly jump forward or backward in time.</li><li>A processor may pause for a significant amount of time (perhaps due to a stop-the-world garbage collection), be declared dead by other nodes, and then come back to life with no idea that it was paused.</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe fact that such partial failures can occur is the defining characteristic of distributed systems. Whenever software tries to do anything involving other nodes, there is a chance that it may occasionally fail, randomly go slow, or not respond at all.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTo tolerate faults, the first step is to detect them, but even that is hard. Most systems rely on failures, but these cannot detect between network and node failures and variable network delays can sometimes cause a node to be falsely suspected of crashing. Moreover, sometimes a node can be in a degraded state. Such a node that is “<b>limping</b>” but not dead can be even more difficult to deal with.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOnce a fault is detected, getting the system to tolerate it is not easy either. There are no global variables, no shared memory, no common knowledge among the machines. Nodes cannot even agree what time it is, let alone anything more significant. The only way nodes can communicate is over an unreliable network. Major decisions cannot be made by one node, so we must use protocols to enlist help from other nodes and try to get a quorum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tIf you can solve problems on a single machine, do it. Distributed computing is hard and you can do a lot on a single machine these days. However, scalability, fault tolerance, and low latency (data close to users around the world) cannot be solved on a single machine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tTangent on time: Is the unreliable nature or networks, clocks, and processes inevitable? No, it is possible to give hard real-time response guarantees and bounded delays in networks, but doing so is very expensive and results in lower hardware utilization. Most non-safety-critical systems choose cheap and unreliable over expensive and reliable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSuper computers: Supercomputers assume reliable components and must be stopped and restarted when a component fails. By contrast, distributed systems can run forever without being interrupted at the service level, because all faults and maintenance can be handled at the node level. In practice, however, a bad configuration change rolled out to all nodes could bring the entire system down.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>\n\tThis chapter was all about problems, the next will focus on
