A real world user, however, would likely use the calculator in many different ways. There were a multitude of orders in which the user might press various buttons. Additionally, there had to be ways of dealing with inputs that didn\'t make much sense at all (ex. What would happen if the user inputted: + - 53 + / 4 - 4?).
