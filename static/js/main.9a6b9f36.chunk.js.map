                  </ul>\n                            With a free weekend, I wanted to explore \n                            Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit\">SpriteKit</a>, and \n                            maybe dip my toes into game design. I followed \n                            a <a href=\"https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/36/\">tutorial</a> from \n                            Hacking with Swift, and found that SpriteKit made the physics and world \n                            building aspect of game development really simple! After following the \n                            tutorial and building the \"Crashy Plane\" game (a clone \n                            of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird\">Flappy Bird</a>), I \n                            wanted to try building my own game. I built a simple platform game, \n                            where a user attempts to dodge oncoming \n                            obstacles and make it to the end of the level (the game turned out suspiciously \n                            like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Impossible_Game\">another game</a> that \n                            I enjoyed in the early 2010's). I had a lot of fun building this, \n                            particularly because it gave me an excuse to play around with \n                            making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art\">pixel art</a>, and \n                            an opportunity to do some custom sound design work. Feel free to check \n                            out the Beta version of the app! Despite naming it \"The Easy Game\", I \n                            find the current build fairly hard to beat...\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">May 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Glch Photo App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Swift, Core Image Framework</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/1ZTQ3ZSX\">App Beta</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.robbiegay.art/apps/glch\">App Info Page</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            Glch is a glitch/distorted photo generator. The user opens the app and \n                            is presented with a custom camera controller. There are no parameters for the \n                            user to adjust. Rather, when the user takes a photo, one of 14 photo distortion \n                            effects is randomly applied. The user then has the option to save the photo or discard it \n                            and try again. I wanted the UX to be optimized for quick experimentation by taking new photos. All buttons are therefore situated on the bottom of the screen, allowing \n                            for rapid, single-handed use. As mentioned above, the current iteration has 14 filters. It \n                            is my goal to continue to add filters (likely until I have 25-50 total), and then publish to the \n                            app store. The filters are built using \n                            Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage\">Core Image</a> framework. \n                            Feel free to download the app Beta!\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">April 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Aja's Poetry Website</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>React.js, Bootstrap, React Router</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/aja-poetry/\">Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/aja-poetry\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            I promised my friend Aja that I would make a website for her months ago. \n                            Unfortunately, between job hunting and freelance work, this has been something \n                            I have repeatedly put off. With a free Saturday evening, I decided to sit down and \n                            build her a site. This is a pretty standard website, built using React.js and Bootstrap, \n                            although I did find a \n                            cool <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-animation\" title=\"React Typing Animation\">typing animation</a> package \n                            to add simple animation to the splash page.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">April 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Instagram Clone iOS App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Swift, Firebase, AVFoundation, PhotoKit</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsI42rxDQs\">Video Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/learning-swift/tree/master/instagram-firebase-clone\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            In order to better understand Swift and mobile app development, I created a clone of \n                            the Instagram app, with backend data being stored on Firebase. Similar to the actual \n                            Instagram app, there is a Home feed where users can scroll through and view posts from \n                            users that they follow. In this feed, users can like, unlike and comment on posts. There is \n                            also a Capture Photo button that utilizes \n                            the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation\" title=\"AVFoundation Documentation Page\">AVFoundation framework</a> to \n                            build a custom camera interface to capture and save new photos. The Search page allows users to search for \n                            and follow and unfollow users. The Home feed has a drag-to-update feature to reflect changes in \n                            users that they follow. The Photo Selector controller utilizes \n                            the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit\" title=\"PhotoKit Documentation Page\">PhotoKit SDK</a> to \n                            create a page for selecting photos from your camera roll. The selected photo can then be \n                            shared to your profile. Finally, users can visit their Profile page where they can view \n                            the number of posts they have shared, users that they follow, and users that follow \n                            them.

This iteration of my website is built \n                            using Bootstrap and React.js for the front end. The page navigation is run through \n                            React Router. For the homepage, I wanted to do something that both showcased some technical \n                            skill in Web Developer, as well as something creative from my background \n                            in the arts. I created a homepage that animates through a range of \"sunrise-ey\" colors, and which \n                            increases in luminosity as the user moves their mouse vertically from the bottom to the \n                            top of the page.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">February 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Calculator iOS App</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title className=\"text-left\">Swift, Xcode, UIKit, TinyConstraints</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koZmsJvPW5k\">Video Demo</a>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/learning-swift/tree/master/calculator-app\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                            To help learn basic iOS app development, I wanted to create a iOS version of a web based \n                            app I had previously completed. During the Awesome Inc Bootcamp, I built \n                            a <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/calculator/\" title=\"Live demo of my JS Calculator\">calculator app</a> using \n                            JavaScript.

I used \n                            Apple's <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit\" title=\"UIKit Documentation Page\">UIKit framework</a> to \n                            build the various buttons and displays and used Robert-Hein \n                            Hooijmans's <a href=\"https://github.com/roberthein/TinyConstraints\">TinyConstraints</a> as \n                            syntactic sugar for Auto Layout.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">February 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n            </CardDeck>\n            <br />\n            <CardDeck>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Phone Simulator</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>React.js and Hooks</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/phone-sim/\">Demo</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/phone-sim\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                            For the Phone Simulator, I combined 6 projects that we worked on during\n                            the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. The Phone Simulator displays the\n                            current time at the top of the \"screen\". Below that, there is a weather\n                            module that pulls realtime weather data based on your current location.\n                            Below the weather app is a countdown timer (currently set to countdown\n                            to my birthday — March 21st). Below the countdown timer are three\n                            applications: Calculator, Todo List, and Mind Reader.\n                            <br /><br />\n                            For this project, I wanted to \n                            use <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\" title=\"React Hooks Documentation\">React Hooks</a>, as\n                            these are a feature of React that I was previously not too familiar with.\n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">January 2020</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>MPM²</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>Laravel, Tone.js, and Pts.js</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDrPAQl78dc\">Demo Video</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/mpm2\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JbRhZaKWOODtXd37rOMaf0eFnQ-lcVgyZ77g5flP2Tc/edit?usp=sharing\">MVP Document</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnKe355iV3o\">Demo Day Presentation Video</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                            Prior to the Fall 2019 Bootcamp, I spent several years making electronic music and, \n                            for the past year, hosted a talk show on WRFL interviewing music makers.

The most challenging\n                            aspect was dealing with various \"edge-case\" scenarios. The calculator would\n                            work pretty well if users performed a basic math function (ex. 5 + 3), then \n                            cleared the memory (\"C\" button), and then performed another basic math \n                            function. A real world user, however, would likely use the calculator in \n                            many different ways. There were a multitude of orders in which the user \n                            might press various buttons. Additionally, there had to be ways of dealing with\n                            inputs that didn't make much sense at all (ex. What would happen if the\n                            user inputted: + - 53 + / 4 - 4?). And the final (and perhaps most difficult)\n                            part of dealing with edge-cases was getting to a point where you had several \n                            fixes for very specific situations, and then had to try to not break any of \n                            those old fixes whenever you implemented a fix for a new scenario.                       \n                        </Card.Text>\n                    </Card.Body>\n                    <Card.Footer>\n                        <small className=\"text-muted\">October 2019</small>\n                    </Card.Footer>\n                </Card>\n                <Card>\n                    <Card.Header>Tic-Tac-Toe</Card.Header>\n                    <Card.Body>\n                        <Card.Title>HTML and JavaScript</Card.Title>\n                        <Card.Text>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/tic-tac-toe/\">Demo</a>\n                                </li>\n                                <li>\n                                    <a href=\"https://github.com/robbiegay/tic-tac-toe\">GitHub Repo</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul>\n                            Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two users to play against each\n                            other.

I took a 1-credit\n                    \"Digital Music Production\" course, and with the help of my professor, Dr. Dan Worley,\n                    made a remix of an XX song.

I moved in with my parents, worked several part-time jobs, and spent most\n                    of my time making music. During the next 3 years, I made lot of music while also reviving some old passions in\n                    filmmaking (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/robbiegay\" title=\"filmmaking portfolio\">filmmaking portfolio</a>) and\n                    photography (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/robbiegay/\" title=\"photography portfolio\">photography portfolio</a>).\n                </p>\n                <iframe title=\"NITRO (robbiegay remix)\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/869678896&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" />\n                \n                <br /><br />\n                <p>\n                    After 3 years of working in the arts, I decided that I wanted to pursue a day job that was\n                    both interesting and financially in-demand. I was really fortunate to hear\n                    about Awesome Inc's  <a href=\"https://www.awesomeinc.org/bootcamp\" title=\"Bootcamp Website\">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>, and\n                    I spent the Fall of 2019 completing that course. During this time, I took a break from making music.\n                    I had become burnt out on trying to make a living making music. During the Spring of 2020, I began to slowly\n                    get back into making music, but this time with a focus on exploring ideas that interested me and having fun.\n                </p>\n                <iframe title=\"pitter_patter\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/929164231&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\" />\n\n                <br /><br /><br /><br />\n                <Container>\n                    <Row>\n                        <Col xs={3}></Col>\n                        <Col xs={6}>\n                            <p className=\"text-justify\">\n                                <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3qNg01UJiLcqaPPWVlsdwc?si=n1XE-bGpQ_O9wS69UGQFug\" title=\"My Spotify Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-spotify\" style={{ color: \"#1ed761\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"}\n                                <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/robbiegay\" title=\"My SoundCloud Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-soundcloud\" style={{ color: \"#ff6c02\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"}\n                                {/* <a href=\"https://robbiegay.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"My BandCamp Page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-bandcamp\" style={{ color: \"#1ea1c3\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a>{\" \"} */}\n                                {/* <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/robbiegay\" title=\"My YouTube Channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-youtube\" style={{ color: \"#ff0000\", fontSize: largerSize }}></i></a> */}\n                                {/* Hack to spread the icons evenly across the line */}\n                                <span style={{ width: \"100%\", display: \"inline-block\" }}></span>\n                            </p>\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col xs={3}></Col>\n                    </Row>\n                </Container>\n            </PageFormat>\n\n            <Footer />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Music;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Card, Row, Col } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction AuthorCard(props) {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <heading>\n                <h1 className=\"pt-4 pb-3 text-center\">{props.title}</h1>\n\n                <Card style={{maxWidth: \"300px\"}}>\n                    <Row className=\"no-gutters\">\n                        <Col xs={4}>\n                            <Card.Img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/images/headshot-march-2020.jpg\"} />\n                        </Col>\n                        <Col xs={8}>\n                            <Card.Body>\n                                <Card.Title>Robbie Gay</Card.Title>\n                                <Card.Text>{props.date}</Card.Text>\n                            </Card.Body>\n                        </Col>\n                    </Row>\n                </Card>\n                <br />\n\n            </heading>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default AuthorCard;","import React from \"react\";\n\nfunction PWWeek1() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Welcome!</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Welcome to my blog!

I’d\n                    seen images of learning\n                    curves, and read various theories about the path someone takes when learning a new skill, but I\n                    had never stumbled\n                    across something that broke it down like this graphic did.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The graphic itself has 3 sections: confidence, resource density, and scope of knowledge. As you\n                    progress\n                    left to right, you go through various stages for each, while steadily increasing your\n                    competency. What I liked\n                    most about this was the confidence meter and the resource density sections.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    I think that anyone who has tried to learn a new skill has likely experienced that initial boost\n                    in confidence.\n                    You start learning a new skill and (because you started at zero) you progress very quickly.\n                    You’re flying through\n                    the plethora of beginner's resources and climbing the learning curve so rapidly that you’re\n                    <em>convinced</em> that\n                    this time next week you’ll be working for Google. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Then you crest that initial hill. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    When you started, you didn’t know enough to know what you didn’t know. As such, you felt like it\n                    would be pretty\n                    simple to acquire all of the information you would need. Now, after a few weeks of rapid\n                    learning, you finally know\n                    enough about whatever skill you are learning to realize just how much you have left to learn.\n                    Your small pond\n                    turned out to be a big ocean. And that’s where the confidence drop comes from — correspondingly,\n                    it’s also likely\n                    that this is where most newcomers flame out.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    To add to this blow, the graphic also shows a rapid increase in resource\n                    scarcity. My own thoughts on this are that there are two markets for those who create such\n                    resources:\n                </p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Beginners</li>\n                    <li>Experts (Paid Professionals)</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>\n                    In most fields, there are likely way more people in the beginning market than at any other\n                    junction.\n                    So, despite the fact that beginners likely aren’t making money yet\n                    (and therefore don’t have much money to invest in learning resources), the sheer size of this\n                    market makes\n                    it appealing for resource creators to create content for. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    At the other end of the spectrum, experts likely represent a small percentage of the total\n                    audience. Since they are paid for\n                    their work, however, they can likely afford to pay a premium for advanced level knowledge\n                    resources. This leaves\n                    a small market for those skill-learners who are beyond the scope of the beginner resource but\n                    below the level\n                    of the expert resource. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    This creates a “desert of despair”, as the graphic calls it, where your confidence level is\n                    knocked down\n                    several pegs AND those learning resources that helped you advance so quickly early on are\n                    becoming more\n                    and more scarce. <br />\n                    <br />\n                    This learning curve graphic goes on to point out that:\n                </p>\n                <ol>\n                    <li>Despite this feeling of hopelessness, <strong>others before you have had the same\n                            experience</strong>.\n                        The graphic encourages us to keep pushing.</li>\n                    <li>Despite the fluctuations in confidence and resources, your competencey is steadily\n                        increasing\n                        throughout this journey.</li>\n                </ol>\n                <p>\n                    Note: I didn’t mention the 3rd category, \"scope of knowledge\" — that’s basically showing how a\n                    beginner\n                    absorbs broad fundamentals early on before specializing (and decreasing total breadth of\n                    knowledge) later on in their journey.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    ~Phew~ Sorry for the big rant on learning curves — on to the meat and potatoes of Prework Week\n                    1.\n                    <br /><br />\n\n                    <h3>DVCS: Git and GitHub</h3>\n\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The focus of our first week of prework was getting up to speed on Git and Github.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    What is Git?\n                </p>\n\n                <blockquote className=\"blockquote bg-light px-5 py-2 my-4 rounded-pill\">\n                    \"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything\n                    from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.” <cite className=\"blockquote-footer\"><a\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a></cite>\n                </blockquote>\n\n                <p>\n                    Great — but what is a DVCS?<br />\n                    <br />\n                    To start, VCS is a Version Control System. My one-week-of-coding-experience definition of a VCS\n                    is that it allows you to track and document changes to code (including reverting to older\n                    versions\n                    of the code). A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a VCS that is mirrored on multiple\n                    devices.\n                    For example, if I have a full copy of the code on my computer and you have an identical copy on\n                    yours,\n                    then we have a <em>distributed</em> copy of the code.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    But what if I change my copy — now our copies aren't aligned, right? That’s where the “version\n                    control system”\n                    comes into play.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    A DVCS like Git tracks any changes I make, and then allows me to merge those changes into a\n                    shared code.\n                    You could then update your copy of the code to match that shared code, and then add your own\n                    changes.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com\" title=\"GitHub\">GitHub</a> is a cloud based code repository. So, if\n                    we each\n                    have our copies of the code, we could place a third copy on GitHub. This saves us time, as I no\n                    longer\n                    have to drive to your house for us to compare code versions.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/git-stages.png\" alt=\"Example of Git Workflow\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Source: <a className=\"minimalLink\"\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository\">\"Intro\n                            to Git\"</a></figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    This oversimplified explanation of Git doesn’t even begin to get into some of the more complex\n                    (or, to me, confusing) functions of Git.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Challenges</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I found Git pretty hard to understand. For one, working in Command Line meant that there wasn’t\n                    much\n                    of a user interface. It sometimes felt like you were flying in the dark — entering commands and\n                    receiving\n                    little to no visual or textual confirmation of what you are doing.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/why-git-is-confusing.png\"\n                        alt=\"Why Git is so confusing\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Source: <a\n                        href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows\">\"Intro to\n                            Git\"</a> (added text mine)</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that helped me was reaching out to my brother, William.{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com/1GWilly8\" title=\"William's GitHub\">William</a>{\" \"}\n                    graduated with a <a href=\"https://www.hanover.edu/academics/programs/cs\"\n                        title=\"Hanover College Computer Science\"><abbr title=\"Computer Science\">CS</abbr> degree</a>{\" \"}\n                    in 2018 and has been working for an <a href=\"https://glowlabs.co\" title=\"Glow Labs\">\n                        <abbr title=\"Internet of Things\">IoT</abbr> company</a> in Denver.

We are working\n                    remotely and I wasn’t really sure what the workload would be like. I found it\n                    to be challenging but manageable, although (perhaps more importantly) I also found it to be\n                    really\n                    fun! I really enjoyed that there is so much to learn at this phase. I also really\n                    liked that so much of the work involves getting hands-on and creating web pages.\n                    Even though the websites we are building are very basic, it felt very satisfying\n                    to be able to apply what we had just learned and see the changes come to life!<br />\n                    <br />\n                    I am really excited to continue working through these prework topics. I’ve enjoyed\n                    some of the design aspects of CSS, and am really looking forward to working with\n                    JavaScript to build more responsive websites!<br />\n                    <br />\n                    I found Git and CSS relatively harder than HTML. The application process for the bootcamp\n                    involved an HTML assignment, and I worked through a Coding Academy course on HTML to help me\n                    with that. I found Git challenging due to the lack of a\n                    <abbr title=\"User Interface\">UI</abbr> as well as some confusion about the various intricacies\n                    of branching, merging, rebasing, etc. I found CSS challenging mostly in the amount of\n                    information to absorb. I think that with both Git and CSS, more time spent working with\n                    them will help me to better digest the information.<br />\n                    <br />\n                    A final reflection is that I really love working in an academic setting that doesn’t\n                    involve quizzes or grades! I think that this is really refreshing — instead of making\n                    flashcards and doing rote memorization, you can approach the subject\n                    matter in whichever way helps you to best absorb and apply the material!\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">A Bonus Resource</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    The prompt for our first blog post asked us for a resource that would help others in the\n                    program.\n                    I’m sure that most bootcampers know of or use something similar to this, but I found an\n                    online coding platform like <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" title=\"CodePen\">CodePen</a>{\" \"}\n                    really helpful.

The focus of this week was an introduction to HTML\n                        and CSS. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. HTML is\n                        not a coding language (it’s a markup language), although if\n                        you looked at a page of HTML, you might be fooled.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/html-looks-like-code.png\"\n                            alt=\"HTML looks like code.

HTML provides the\n                        structure of your webpage and CSS gives it its style. If HTML\n                        is like the frame of your house, CSS is the doors, windows,\n                        paint, etc:\n                    </p>\n\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/html-vs-css.png\" alt=\"Visual analogy of HTML vs CSS\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">HTML is like the frame of a house; CSS adds\n                            style.</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n\n                    <p>\n                        We covered a range of basic HTML and CSS topics, and although\n                        I would love to write a post covering <em>everything</em> we\n                        learned, I would also love to go to sleep at some point tonight.\n                        Instead, here is a very basic introduction to HTML/CSS!\n                    </p>\n\n                    {/* <!--|| HTML Intro --> */}\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">HTML: A very basic introduction</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        The basic building block of HTML is the element.

Pseudo Code is\n                        really useful in the brainstorming phase of your code writing\n                        process, as it allows you to find a happy medium between\n                        super technical real code, and regular, everyday English.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Why find this middle ground? Jumping right into code can be\n                        like starting a journey without any sort of road map. Pseudo code gives\n                        you a chance to outline your work, and maybe see what problems\n                        and challenges you are likely to face. You may be able to\n                        solve some of those problems in this outline, perhaps saving\n                        you the time of starting in the wrong direction!\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Pseudo Code is not full code. The meaning of this is that you\n                        don’t have to worry about the code being technically correct —\n                        there’s no getting bogged down in the complexities of figuring\n                        out how to solve certain problems. For example, in your Pseudo\n                        Code, you might realize that you need to invent a new\n                        algorithm for streaming video. Instead of putting down the pen\n                        and spending hours/days/years (I have no idea how long it take\n                        to write an algorithm) writing your new algorithm, it is enough\n                        to simply know that it is needed — plot it on your roadmap and\n                        move on.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        At the same time, you would want to avoid full on English.\n                        Saying “go find the peanut butter” might not mean much to a\n                        computer. Humans are great at making inferences and thinking\n                        creatively, computers are very literal.

An assignment for acceptance into the Bootcamp\n                        involved building a basic HTML site. To help me\n                        build that, I signed up for a free trial of Code Academy Pro\n                        and worked through an Introduction to HTML course.

I’m very excited, but maybe\n            also a little nervous.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    This week involved diving a little deeper into HTML and CSS, while\n                    also serving as an introduction to JavaScript. Additionally, we\n                    did our first Demo Day on Friday! As we are working remotely, this\n                    was done via group video chat. We all took turns demonstrating the\n                    functionality of our Silly Story Generators, as well as looking\n                    under the hood and showcasing/explaining the source code behind\n                    our projects.\n                    </p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">JavaScript</h3>\n                <p>\n                    JavaScript is a coding language that is used on both the client\n                    and server sides. On the client side, it is used to add reactive\n                        elements to a website. JavaScript <strong>IS NOT</strong> the same\n            as the similarly popular programing language, Java. In fact, the\n            only reason that they are named in a similar fashion is because\n            Java was becoming very popular at the time, and the creators of\n            JavaScript thought that they could benefit from Java’s popularity\n            by adopting a similar name. This seems a little like the current\n            naming convention involving adding Blockchain or Cryptocurrency to\n            various new products.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    A final interesting fact about JavaScript — its creator,{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich\">Brendan Eich</a>,\n                wrote the prototype of the language{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Beginnings_at_Netscape\"\n                        title=\"History of JavaScript (Wikipedia)\">in just 10 days</a>.

A website like this,\n                    however, is considered static — you can’t change elements without\n                    reloading the page. JavaScript allows you to create dynamic websites.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    In the above example of a house, JavaScript would allow you to\n                    click on the front door and see the door open, and your neighbors\n                    walk out!\n                    </p>\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/html-vs-css-vs-js-house.png\"\n                        alt=\"An image comparing JS to a House\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">JavaScript creates reactive websites — Similar to\n                        being able to click on a house and\n                        open the\n                            door</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>\n                    You’ve likely seen examples of JavaScript all over the web.\n                    Examples might include: pressing the “like” button on Facebook and\n                    seeing the total number of “likes” instantly increase. Or, as you\n                    scroll through Instagram, a post changes from “posted 3 minutes\n                    ago” to “posted 4 minutes ago” in real time.

What looks nice and spacious on\n                    a widescreen, became very compressed on a mobile device.\n                    </p>\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid border\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/css-not-scaling-well-to-mobile.png\"\n                        alt=\"CSS not scaling well to mobile view\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The same blog post viewed on a mobile device\n                        </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>\n                    Unfortunately, attempting to remedy this made things much worse\n                    before they got any better. For a while, not only did the site not\n                    look good on mobile, but elements started to appear in strange\n                    places on desktop as well.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    Although we learned about Git in our first week of Prework, it\n                    wasn’t until I attempted to resize my blog that I became a real\n                        believer. I should first say that this came about <em>not</em>\n                    because I used Git properly and that it helped me to fix my\n                    website, but rather, that I didn’t use a good Gitflow Strategy,\n                    and that I ended up wishing fervently that I had!\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    I was using a “dev” (development) branch to write my code, but\n                    only doing so so that I could get into the habit. Once I had an\n                    update, I would immediately merge with the local master branch and\n                    then push to GitHub. This was unfortunate, because even though my code\n                    was moving in the right direction, things, at least temporarily,\n                    looked worse than before. If I had been using Git properly, I\n                    could have left my master branch as a functioning version of the\n                    site, while working on my dev branch until things were up to\n                    publication quality.

Needless to say, this did not work\n                    as planned either the first (or twenty-first) time that I tried to\n                    run the program. The first thing that I looked for were syntax\n                    errors. You can think of these as grammar or spelling mistakes.\n                    This is like when you text someone: “on my way, soon” when you\n                    really meant to say “one my way, noon” — A simple error that might\n                    have someone waiting around for several hours. Computers being\n                    very literal machines, these simple grammar and spelling errors\n                    can cause a program to cease functioning entirely.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    After first addressing any syntactical errors that I could find in\n                    my Silly Story Generator, I then had to deal with any logic\n                    errors. A logic error is when you tell a program how to perform a\n                    task, they are able to complete said task, but then, because of an\n                    error in the logic of your instructions, the task completed does\n                    not produce the desired results.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    A real-world example of a logic error could be to give someone\n                    directions to your house. Perhaps you managed to spell everything\n                    correctly and produce easy to follow directions (no syntax\n                    errors), but you then told them to turn left on Main St. instead\n                    of right! The instructions worked well, they just sent your friend\n                    in the wrong direction.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    I found dealing with logic errors really frustrating. I would find\n                    myself reading and rereading my code, and eventually coming to the\n                        conclusion that my code definitely <em>should</em> work; It\n                        <em>seemed</em> like everything made sense. There were even\n                                moments when I would just stare at the screen, unable to find\n                                anything to tweak or try.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    It seemed like there were no real “ah-ha” moments of getting this\n                    week's code to work — rather than a large change that fixed the\n                    program, it was several small implementations that eventually\n                    built some functioning code.{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer\"\n                        title=\"Pragmatic Programmer Wikipedia\">The\n                            Pragmatic Programmer</a>{\" \"}\n                    mentions a Japanese phrase, “kaizen”.

When working in HTML, there is a lot of\n                    framework that gets recycled on every page. After my first couple\n                    of webpages, I got tired of repeatedly building the same\n                    structure. I had decided that it would be really useful to build a\n                    template to start with.

For example, if my code wasn’t\n                                    displaying a string pulled from an array, is that because it isn’t\n                                    pulling the string from the array at all, or is the computer\n                                    having trouble inputting said string back into our story? With\n                                    Chrome Dev Tools, you are able to insert a breakpoint, and to then\n                        <em>see</em> how the computer is thinking.

Most of the challenges of working with\n                    JavaScript involved coping with the various highs and lows of\n                    creative problem solving.

Then, the low of this solution only managing to break\n                    what you had working before. One thing that helped was to not\n                    immediately wad your new idea up and throw it in the trash.\n                    I found that many times, pausing to comb through your code for\n                    syntax errors could be really helpful — as maybe your new solution\n                        <em>might</em> actually work if you hadn’t misspelled a variable\n                    or left out a bracket.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    Another thing that I found really helpful was occasionally closing\n                    my computer. For one, just taking breaks and maybe mulling over a\n                    problem while you took a walk could often leave to breakthroughs,\n                    to thinking, \"why hadn't I thought of that yet\". And second, I\n                    found that beginning your code with just pen and paper was a really helpful\n                    way to start. By forcing myself to slow down, to work through ALL\n                    the steps of the problem, and to chart out ALL the functionalities\n                    I would need, would often lead to developing a better roadmap and\n                    better code. I was then able, still with\n                    pen and paper, to start solving these problems and adding\n                    various functionalities. This made the act of writing the code\n                    a little bit like filling in the blanks.\n                    </p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Bootcamp</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I am <strong>super</strong> excited to start Bootcamp Week 1 on Monday!\n                    </p>\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/time-till-bootcamp-starts.png\"\n                        alt=\"Countdown till Sept. 16th, 2019\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Counting down to Day 1!</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>\n                    I felt like we learned a lot more than I expected to in this\n                    introductory period, and I am really stoked to see what we\n                    will be learning in our first few weeks of Bootcamp!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default PWWeek4;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\n\nfunction PWWeek2() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    We just wrapped up Bootcamp Week 1 — it was really\n                    exciting to dive into our first week of full-time\n                    coding, but it also came with some personal highs and lows.\n                    A high was that the first week of Bootcamp was a\n                    lot of fun!

After our design workshop wrapped\n                    up, I turned back to my blog and realized just how much additional\n                    design work my blog could use! I really enjoyed learning more\n                    about design, and am looking forward to our future design theory sessions.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    This week we started working with the Bootstrap framework. A framework\n                    is a software abstraction that adds certain functionality to common code.\n                    The main difference between a framework and a library is \"inversion of control\" —\n                    in a framework, the global flow of control is employed by the framework, rather\n                    than the user. What using Bootstrap meant for me, was that I could\n                    take something that previously took me 40-50 lines of CSS, and enter only a\n                    word or two of Bootstrap and achieve the same effect… often with\n                    even better results. Switching from vanilla CSS to Bootstrap was\n                    a bit like being given superpowers — it was amazing what sort of\n                    features I could add to my blog with just a few Bootstrap classes!\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">JavaScript Objects</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I definitely struggled with understanding JavaScript objects at\n                        first. I tried reading the “objects” chapter in{\" \"}\n                    <a title=\"Eloquent JavaScript\" href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html\">“Eloquent JavaScript”</a>{\" \"}\n                    on Monday. By “tried to read”, I mean that I made it about halfway through\n                    before becoming so lost that I only skimmed the rest, knowing that nothing else was going to\n                        stick. Later in the week, I began working through the <a title=\"MDN JS Objects Module\"\n                        href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects\"> MDN JavaScript\n                        Objects module</a>. Getting to read a second explanation of JS objects really helped me begin\n                    to understand what objects are &lpar;hint: they are everything, and everything is them&rpar;\n                    and why they are useful.\n                    </p>\n                <p>\n                    We rounded out the week by completing an assignment that\n                    involved applying what we had learned about JS objects.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center text-secondary d-none d-sm-block\">Bouncing Balls Game</h3>\n\n                {/* <!-- Bouncing Balls Game (only appears on sm size and larger) --> */}\n                <div className=\"border embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3 mb-1 d-none d-sm-block\">\n                    <iframe className=\"embed-responsive-item\" title=\"Bouncing Balls Game\" height=\"515\"\n                        src=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/bouncing-balls/\">\n                    </iframe>\n                </div>\n\n                <p className=\"d-none d-sm-block text-secondary pb-3\"><small>\n                    Instructions: Control the red circle with WASD keys.

It was nice to still have a bit of hand holding throughout this project, as it allowed\n                    us to build a fairly “complex” &lpar;complex to me&rpar; program, and to see how objects made\n                    a program like this possible.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Coming Attractions</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Over the next two weeks, we are going to be diving a bit more deeply into\n                    JavaScript, while also doing a lot of project-based work.

I worked on\n                    three projects this week: a Weather App, a Tic-Tac-Toe\n                    game, and a Calculator. Each of these projects was built\n                    using JavaScript, and each helped introduce us to some\n                    new aspect of the language.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>This Week’s Projects</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    <a href=\"https://robbiegay.github.io/weather-app/\" title=\"My Weather App\">The Weather App</a>{\" \"}\n                    was designed to take a user-inputted zip-code, and output\n                    real-time weather conditions for that area. This project\n                    introduced us to APIs and JSON. APIs are Application\n                    Programming Interfaces, sets of code governing access\n                    points to servers or databases. JSON stands for JavaScript\n                    Object Notation, and is a standardized data format.

This project seemed pretty\n                     straight forward at first — computers should be pretty good\n                     at adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying. The problem,\n                     however, lay in the fact that there are a multitude of\n                     combinations for which the user could input values. What\n                     happens if the user presses: - + 5 6 - / 3 =? Should the computer\n                     ignore the opening two operands? 5 and 6 pressed sequentially\n                     should obviously form “56”. And what about the “- /“? Should\n                     the computer ignore the first operand in this case as well?\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    There were many edge cases, and, on my first attempt at creating\n                    the calculator, I tried to solve all of these scenarios from\n                    the beginning. This resulted in a somewhat functioning calculator,\n                    but at the expense of running some very convoluted code behind\n                    the scenes. I decided to start fresh and create a second JS sheet,\n                    and to focus on just solving core problems first. After I had\n                    some fairly clean code working, I then began to\n                    incrementally add edge case solutions.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Additionally, the Calculator was my first time dynamically\n                    rendering an application in JavaScript. The body of my HTML\n                    document only contains a single &lt;div&gt; element for the\n                    JavaScript to build the app on.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Process</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    My biggest take away from Bootcamp Week 2 was that I started\n                    to think about and establish a personal development process.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My first step is to read over the project parameters, and to\n                    Pseudo Code the problem. I will draw out the potential UI,\n                    thinking about how various elements will scale at different\n                    screen sizes, as well as what elements are clickable and how\n                    various elements should interact.

This gives me\n                    something to work with and test code upon. If you need to\n                    test what happens when a button gets pressed, it’s pretty\n                    hard to do so if you haven’t built any buttons yet!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My next step is to build the core functionality of the project.\n                    This MVP will fulfill the broad requirements for functionality,\n                    while leaving edge cases to a later step. Throughout this\n                    process, I will likely come up with ideas for new features,\n                    or think of possible edge case problems. In order to not get\n                    sidetracked, I will jot down these ideas on a pad of paper.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Once I get the core functionality working, I will then begin\n                        solving for edge cases. <a href=\"http://ianrios.me/\" title=\"Ian's Website\">Ian</a>{\" \"}\n                    recommended that I prioritize edge cases by using a four-quadrant\n                    grid.

This involved working with the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" title=\"MDN Documentation - Local Storage\">Local Storage API</a> to store entries even when you close your web browser or refresh the page. One useful thing that I did for the To-Do app — and which I might do again in the future — was to write some code for custom hotkeys. During the development process, I would often change my code and needed to test it with a totally refreshed page. Since Local Storage retains data between page loads, it became more difficult to quickly load a brand new version of the webpage. Because of this, I decided to map the <code>=</code> key to some lines of code that cleared the Local Storage (as well as emptying the array the held data related to the To-Do List entries). Additionally, I mapped the <code>-</code> key to trigger several useful <code>console.log()</code>’s. This meant that I could quickly get a status update on several of the key functions of the app — without these logs cluttering up the console upon every action.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/to-do-custom-hotkeys.png\" alt=\"My To-Do code\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">I mapped some custom hotkeys in my To-Do List app</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Frameworks and Libraries</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    The prompt for this week’s blog post asked: “Why do you see JavaScript frameworks and libraries [as] useful or hard to use?” I thought that this was an interesting question, as I would likely answer that I find frameworks and libraries as both useful AND hard to use (at least at first).\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    JavaScript frameworks and libraries are really useful — they abstract away a lot of functionality, allowing you to write code that is both clean and highly functional. Cleaner code allows for easier debugging and maintenance. Additionally, many of the functionalities contained within these frameworks or libraries solve complex problems that took entire teams of highly skilled individuals to solve. Many coders (especially novice ones like myself) would be hard pressed to solve these problems, let alone with code that remains remotely legible.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    And in answer to the second part of the prompt: I also think that frameworks and libraries can be difficult to learn. Picking up any new aspect of coding can be challenging. You often work really hard to attain some level of competency in a certain area, and then a new framework or library comes knocking at our door. This new tech offers increased functionality and powerful new features, but comes at the cost of jumping (yet again) into the <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/blog/coding_is_hard_confidence_competence.png\" title=\"Graphic from Erik Trautman's 'Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard'\">desert of despair</a>. Couple this with the fact that you may then have to refactor many of your old projects in order to incorporate this new tech, and you might be tempted to slam your door on the framework/library salesman and go back to the comfort of your old code. As tempting as this is, I think that the added functionality of new frameworks/libraries, as well as the opportunity to keep your 'learning muscle' strong, more than justifies the mental discomfort and extra work — even if it will always remain tempting to stay within your comfort zone --> &#128563;.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    [Bonus content: Since I added an emoji above, here is a <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp\" title=\"w3schools - Emoji Reference Page\">great resource</a> for adding emoji's to your code!]\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Coming Attractions: React</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Next week we will begin working with the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\" title=\"The React Website\">React library</a>.

Snippets are lines of text that you can program to auto-complete into useful lines of code! I wrote a snippet for quickly adding <code>console-log()</code>’s to my code: you type in <code>lll</code> (three lowercase L’s), and then press <code>Enter</code>. This converts the <code>lll</code> into a new <code>console.log();</code>, with the text input cursor placed in the parentheses for quickly typing what you want to log.

This can be\n                    very useful: you can write a component for a button. This button\n                    component can contain all of the necessary code for a button (its shape,\n                    what happens when it is clicked, etc).

For the first few days,\n                    I felt like I was aimlessly adrift. There\n                    was so much to learn, that I wasn’t even sure where to turn my\n                    boat. Slowly I was able to gain a little traction — I would\n                    pick a project, experiment with React, and see what I could learn. A big part was being\n                    willing to break things and make mistakes.

Here is an example of how these\n                    breaks would work:\n                    </p>\n\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li>25 minutes of work</li>\n                    <li>5 minute break</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <p>\n                    After 4 of these Pomodoros, you then take a longer 15-30 minute break. An\n                    important aspect of a Pomodoro is that it is indivisible —\n                    you have to work for the full 25 minutes, and you have to maintain\n                    your state of focus throughout. I found that I was able to keep my\n                    focus much more effectively in these short bursts. Beyond this improved\n                    focus, I found the real value in the type of breaks that I took.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    During my Pomodoro breaks, I tried to do something that didn’t involve a screen. Here are some\n                    examples of breaks that I took:\n                        <ul>\n                        <li>Short walk around the block</li>\n                        <li>Light stretching in the hallway (lots of great natural light!)</li>\n                        <li>Same hallway: opened the window, felt the sun and wind on my face, and did some\n                                yoga-like mindful breathing</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    These breaks might seem silly, but it was amazing how much a short break like\n                    this improved my cognitive function. Every time I returned from these\n                    breaks, I sat down at my desk totally refreshed! I found that I had the same\n                    level of energy that I was used to experiencing only at the start of the day!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Remembering and following through with taking breaks\n                    can be a challenge — It can be pretty tempting to remain in your chair! That\n                    said, I hope to continue to take breaks like this, as I think that they\n                    really help me do my best work!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek5;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek2() {\n    return (\n        <>\n{/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n                <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Weekly Update</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Week 6 of the Bootcamp was pretty fun!{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://wildercat.github.io/\" title=\"Abram's Blog\">Abram</a>{\" \"}\n                        brought in his GameCube and we played some lunchtime{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee\" title=\"Wikipedia Page\">Melee</a>. \n                        Todd showed us his favorite game —{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Monkey_Ball_(video_game)\" title=\"Wikipedia Page\">Monkey Ball</a> — \n                        it was pretty fun but I was not very good at it.

It is a \n                        little wild that the course has flown by so quickly. \n                        At the same time, as we started to refactor some of our earlier projects \n                        this week, I realized just how much ground we have covered in such a short period of time. \n                        I’m having a lot of fun in the Bootcamp, so it is a little bittersweet to \n                        think that the rest of the Bootcamp might fly by as well.

It took me most of week 5 before I even \n                        felt like I was gaining any traction. Last weekend, I got a full night's sleep \n                        and spent part of Sunday re-reading the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">React documentation</a>. \n                        This week, I worked through the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\">React tutorial</a>{\" \"}\n                        for the second time, and read through the documentation \n                        a third. Each time through, I would make it further and further before my comprehension \n                        level would start to drop. By the end of the week, I was starting to feel well \n                        versed in the basics of React — just in time to switch gears and start learning \n                        MySQL and PHP. &#128579;\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h3 className=\"text-center\">Next Week: Back End Development</h3>\n\n                    <p>\n                        Next week we will start working with Back End languages.

Front End development \n                        is more client side focused and deals with design and user interfaces. Back End development involves \n                        working with servers and doing more behind-the-scenes work.

We began by\n                        learning some{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://www.php.net/\" title=\"PHP Documentation Site\">PHP</a>.\n            PHP stands for ‘PHP: Hypertext Processor’, which is a recursive acronym,\n            apparently something that programmers love. We built a practice server,\n            and attempted to build an API that could pull data from that server.\n            I might have gone a little bit overboard when I decided to add 1,000,000\n            items to my nonsense database…\n                        </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/million-item-db.png\" alt=\"My example database\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">1 million food items</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    About midweek, we jumped into{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://laravel.com/\" title=\"The Laravel Website\">Laravel</a>.\n            Laravel is a PHP framework that is billed as an elegant and\n            expressive means to do Back End programming. I have really\n            enjoyed learning Laravel so far. We have been working our\n            way through this\n                            \"<a href=\"https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch\" title=\"Laracasts\">Laravel 6 From Scratch</a>\"\n    video series. I find it to be a pretty fun way to learn!\n    I follow along with the video, pausing it to apply what\n    I just learned to my own code. Once I feel like I\n    have come to an understanding about some topic, I then try to\n    summarize it in my notes.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around chapter 3 of the Laracast series, my comprehension\n                    level started to drop. I found the same thing happening\n                    with several of our recent learning endeavors (React, PHP). I\n                    will make a decent amount of progress, but then the wave of\n                    confusion washes over me and I have to swim back to shore.\n                    A solution that I have found is to go ahead and skim over\n                    the remaining material. I don’t stress about the fact that\n                    I am not entirely following along. Rather, I am trying to\n                    get a broad picture, to see how the pieces fit together.\n                    I then go back and read (or watch) the material again.\n                    When I started getting lost in the Laracasts, I turned\n                    the playback speed to 2x and powered through the remaining videos. This\n                    allowed me to get a broad overview of many of the cool Laravel features.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that I have been struggling with is getting enough\n                    sleep. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not falling asleep in class,\n                    but when learning new material, I find that even a little\n                    bit of extra fatigue really hinders my ability to learn\n                    new concepts. My goal for next week, is to go to bed an\n                    hour earlier! That plan sounds great, except that I had\n                    the same goal last week. Oh well.\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I slept in both Saturday and Sunday mornings, and then started\n                    rewatching the Laracasts. I found this really helpful — I\n                    was fresh and alert, and was able to absorb the material\n                    really well. I am really starting to see how useful Laravel\n                    is. Right now, its only hindrance is that it is\n                    so full of features that it can be a little difficult to\n                    understand at first. While working with JavaScript, I would\n                    create one or two JS files, an HTML file, and a CSS file.\n                            When I run <code>Laravel new project name</code>, it makes\n    a massive amount of files. I just went through and tried to count\n    how many files this actually does create. I was around 140~\n    when I got into the vendor bin and realized that it\n    would be a waste of time to keep counting. This is obviously\n    a great thing — look how much functionality comes built in\n    to Laravel. It does mean, however, that the learning curve is a little\n    bit steep, and a fair bit intimidating. I look forward to a\n    time when I can make better use of some of these powerful features!\n                        </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Next week we start the week off with a remote day!{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\" title=\"The Donald's Twitter Page\">President Trump</a>{\" \"}\n                    is holding a political rally in the evening, and most of\n                    downtown will be blocked off starting at 2pm.

On one hand, it seems\n                    like the time has absolutely flown by. I was a little worried that 16 weeks of daily\n                    programming was going to be hard to get through, but now I can’t believe that it’s\n                    almost over! It’s also hard to believe that in July I knew nothing about programming,\n                    and now I feel comfortable with a (small) laundry list of languages and frameworks:\n                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, PHP, MySQL, Laravel…\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Upon completion of the Bootcamp, I hope to continue refining my knowledge portfolio.\n                    I obviously think that I will learn a great deal at whatever job I land at, but I\n                    also hope to use a 30-60-90 day plan to augment that learning with some work on my\n                    own. A 30-60-90 day plan involves determining what you should be working on now\n                    (your 30-day goal), what you plan on working on next (60-day goal), as well as\n                    looking to the future, and brainstorming what might be on the horizon (90-day goal).\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I’m looking forward to this final stretch of the Bootcamp.

The first task\n                    on everyone’s plate was to setup our login and logout functionality. I think\n                    that most of us expected this to be a fairly quick process, and therefore budgeted\n                    a lot of time for other stories. By Friday’s Demo Day, very few people had made\n                    it past the login/logout step.

For mine, I wanted to combine my background in\n                    music production, with the LAMP tech stack that we have covered\n                    in the Bootcamp.\n                    </p>\n\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/final-project-mvp-cover.png\"\n                            alt=\"MVP Cover Page\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">MVP Cover Page</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/final-project-mvp-intro.png\"\n                            alt=\"MVP Intro\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">MVP Intro</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/final-project-mvp-wireframe.png\"\n                            alt=\"MVP Wireframe\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">MVP Wireframe</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <p>\n                    Our MVP proposal serves to both explain what out project\n                    does, and to map out a road map for the development process (including MoSCoW,\n                    stories, and wireframes). Taking the time to really plan out our\n                    project should hopefully save us a lot of time later on — if\n                    there’s one thing I have learned in the Bootcamp, it is the\n                        dangers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_coding\" title=\"Wikipedia: Cowboy Coding\">cowboy coding</a>.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Despite the detailed planning, I still had to remain pretty flexible\n                    during this first week of development. I planned on onboarding two\n                        frameworks/libraries,{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\" title=\"Tone.js Homepage\">Tone.js</a>{\" \"}\n                    (for sound) and{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://ptsjs.org/\" title=\"Pts.js Homepage\">Pts.js</a>{\" \"}\n                    (for visuals). The documentation pages for both of these frameworks/libraries\n                    talked about how simple they are to learn, and the example code was\n                    often only 10-15 lines long. Because of this, I had a certain time\n                    expectation for incorporating in these new techs. Nothing ever\n                    goes quite as planned, and it turned out that Pts doesn’t work all\n                        that well with React (I had to download an auxiliary package{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pts-canvas\" title=\"NPM: react-pts-canvas\">react-pts-canvas</a>).\n                    I ended up getting the synth to work more quickly than the visuals,\n                    and headed into the weekend with a working synth with basic control parameters.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The first week of our final project sprint had its highs and lows.\n                    I really enjoyed the planning process, and was definitely excited\n                    to get started! It was rewarding to see aspects of the process come\n                    to life, although there were times when things weren't working, and I\n                    ended up with less functioning code than I started the day with. Next\n                    week we will only have 3 class days to work on the project before\n                    breaking for Thanksgiving. I hope to get a lot done by Wednesday,\n                    and to then squeeze some work in over the holiday break!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek10;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek11() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    This past week was week two of our final project sprint.\n                    We had three days to work in class (Mon-Wed), before breaking\n                    for Thanksgiving. Next week we will have two more class days\n                    to work on the final project (Mon and Tue), before presenting\n                    to our classmates on Wednesday, and presenting to the general\n                    public on Thursday!

Last week made me realize that time will\n                    play an important role in how much I will be able to get done,\n                    and I wanted to map out a project “prototype” — something with\n                    all of the core functionality, that I could then build on as time allowed.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/mpm2-prototype-kanban.png\" alt=\"Prototype Kanban Board\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Prototype Kanban Board</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    At this point I had a synth with parameter controls, and visuals that DID NOT\n                    yet react to the synth sounds. My synth parameters would store their values in state,\n                    and my first task this week was to try to store these values in my database.\n                    It was pretty straightforward to move the variables themselves, but I quickly\n                    ran into as issue with creating too many API calls. When I would move the\n                    slider once, it would send hundreds of calls to the database. This would\n                    cause a “429 — too many requests\" error. To remedy this, I decided to use\n                    a technique called{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)\" title=\"Wikipedia: Polling\">polling</a>{\" \"}\n                    — basically, checking for updates at regular time\n                    intervals. I found that if I limited myself to one API call per second, I\n                    could mostly avoid 429 errors.\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- Carousel Images --> */}\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/mpm2-synth-controls.png\"\n                            alt=\"Synth Controls\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Basic synth controls</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/mpm2-synth-and-visualizer.png\"\n                            alt=\"Synth Visualizer\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Synth visualizer and 429 errors</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <p>\n                    My next step was to clean up my code. During the process of adding new\n                    features and trying to fix bugs, I would often “comment out” various\n                    fixes. This allowed me to see what I had tried, what had worked, and\n                    what did not. Now that I had some functioning code, I went through and\n                    deleted unused code, cleaned up existing code, and added explanatory comments.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    After lunch (a quick stop at Sahara with Sam and Anna, and a tour of{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"http://nymbl.healthcare/\" title=\"Nymbl's Website\">Nymbl’s</a>{\" \"}\n                    offices), I still had one more problem I wanted to tackle: I was separating\n                    my synth and synth control components, and knew that they wouldn’t have\n                    any common parents to pass state up to. This meant that I needed some way\n                    to store my Boolean value for triggering synth sounds. One strategy that\n                    I attempted was using{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html\" title=\"React Documentation: Context\">React context</a>.\n                Context allows you to store values outside of the parent-child tree.

At this point it\n                    was 6pm, and I decided to go home and sleep on the problem.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Tuesday</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Overslept my alarm — ended up being late to my workout class :(\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Sleeping on my API call problem worked!

It would work, but only in very brief flashes. Today\n                    was another fairly frustrating day — as I worked on one problem all\n                    day and found no solutions. I had both Ian and Justin help me, but\n                    since I was using a library (Pts.js) that they weren’t familiar with,\n                    neither of them had much luck. I stayed until 7pm, felt like I made\n                    no progress, and went home feeling a little defeated.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Wednesday</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Wednesday was our final day before Thanksgiving break, and our last day\n                    to get hands on feedback from the instructors or our classmates. With\n                    only two days of coding remaining when we get back, it was pretty vital\n                    that we be in a good position when we left on Wednesday. Since I was still\n                    solidly blocked with my visualizer issue, Justin told me that he wanted\n                    me to check in at 3pm — and that if I couldn’t solve it by then, then I\n                    may have to consider pivoting on that aspect of my project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In the morning, Ian helped me refactor my Synth and Visuals into one\n                    component. We thought that this would be helpful when attempting to\n                    analyze the sound and have the visuals react.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Since time was short, several of us decided to call in a pizza order.\n                    I asked for extra ranch. A good slice of pizza is wasted without some\n                    ranch to dip it in.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/final-project-pizza.JPG\" alt=\"Final project pizza order\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Pizza (and ranch!!!)</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    After lunch, I again worked with Ian in an attempt to fix my visualizer\n                    problem. Ian was leaving for Denver at 2pm, so time was pretty short.\n                    Ian had worked with me throughout the morning, and was now fairly familiar\n                    with Pts.js — this meant that his feedback was likely my last shot at\n                    completing this aspect of my project. As 2pm rolled around, we were\n                    both feeling pretty dejected — we had tried a whole host of fixes for\n                    the problem, but so far, nothing was working.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    After Ian left, I went out and laid on the couch in the hallway.\n                    I wanted a break from my code, and, as often happens, this gave\n                    my mind a chance to approach the problem from a different angle.\n                    I realized that we had several parts working independently,\n                    and that there seemed to be no reason why we shouldn’t be able\n                    to combine these to get a functioning visualizer. I went back to\n                    our workroom, grabbed my laptop, and  sequestered myself in a side\n                    office to make one last attempt at fixing my code.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I pulled up two different, partially working versions of the code. I began\n                    by commenting things out, section by section, trying to figure out what\n                    was breaking my visualizer. Finally, around 2:45, I commented out a small\n                    “if statement”, and suddenly the visualizer worked! It seems that we had\n                    left some code from a previous fix in our new version, and that it had\n                    been breaking everything else. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about\n                    getting my visualizer to work. I had been pretty bummed about the idea of\n                    giving up on this aspect of my project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/the-code-that-broke-my-visualizer-blur.png\" alt=\"The code that was breaking my visualizer\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The offending code</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    Fixing that issue completed my prototype build.

I mostly worked on some small features,\n                    and planned out what major features I would start tackling on Monday. Some of\n                    the features that I added: fixing the polling bounce issue, adding controls\n                    for manipulating the visualizer, and figuring out how to set an EQ range.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Final Project: Week 2 Reflection</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I wanted to end this blog post with a few things that I have leaned so\n                    far while working on this project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The low hanging fruit would be the new technologies that I have on boarded:{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io/\" title=\"Tone.js Homepage\">Tone.js</a> and{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://ptsjs.org/\" title=\"Pts.js Homepage\">Pts.js</a>. While learning specific frameworks and libraries is\n                important, as a beginner developer, the important lessons that I think I\n                have learned are project management and pragmatic problem solving skills.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    This was the first project where we have designed everything from the\n                    ground up. My initial MVP designated story (task) difficulty using a\n                    point system. A one point story was easy, while an eight point story\n                    could be really really hard. Once I started coding, I found that many\n                    tasks had unexpected components that made them harder than expected.\n                    Within a few days of working on my project, I had to start “pruning”\n                    my stories — prioritizing the most essential stories, and reassigning\n                    point values once I realized the full magnitude of each task.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I have also learned some new strategies for dealing with problems as they\n                        arise. When importing an element (for example, <code>PtsCanvas</code>), you\n                    can right click in{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" title=\"VSCode Website\">VSCode</a> and\n                select “go to definition” to find out how that component is defined. Reading\n                the meaning behind these higher level abstractions can really help you figure\n                out what is going wrong and why.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A second strategy that I learned was to build test code, something much\n                    simpler than the project you are working on. This test code’s only job\n                    is to test out a key piece of functionality which you do not yet understand.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A third technique that I learned is to compare my code to examples used\n                    in the package documentation. When I was struggling to get Pts.js to work,\n                    I looked up some of their example projects that were doing something\n                    similar (sound frequency analyzation). I went through their code line\n                    by line, commenting things out and changing variable values to get a\n                    better understanding of what code controls what aspect of the project.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    And finally, a fourth problem solving technique that I used was to go to\n                    others for help. When asking an instructor or classmate, I would write\n                    down what my specific problem was, make a list of what I have done to\n                    try to solve it, and list out what my theories are regarding why the code\n                    does not work. I found that this helped them better understand my problem,\n                    and quickly orient themselves in my code.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I’m hoping to use these new project management and problem solving skills\n                    in my future software endeavors!\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default BCWeek11;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction BCWeek12() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            {/* <!-- Main Text --> */}\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <p>\n                    Demo day!

The stress levels in the room seemed\n                    noticeably lower than at the end of week 11. At the end of week 11, many of us were still trying\n                    to implement new stories, and the time crunch was bearing down on us. By Monday of week 12, if\n                    we had not yet started a new story, it was likely that that story would now be pushed to a future\n                    sprint. We were now in the process of polishing up our code and making small improvements.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Most of my major stories got wrapped up the previous Friday. The final major story that I was\n                    attempting to implement was a timer function to kick inactive users out of the queue. I got\n                    about halfway done Monday evening before determining that this was unlikely to get done this\n                    sprint, and added it to my features list for next sprint!\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    On Tuesday, I set about tackling my Google Cloud hosting problem. For some reason, Google Cloud\n                    did not like the fact that I used both React and Laravel in one project file. After attempting to\n                    debug this with both Justin and Ian, and with time now running dangerously low, I decided that this\n                    build would have to be run locally, and went about the process of hosting my app from my IP address.\n                    Once I got my site hosted locally\n                    (I implemented it fully sometime Tuesday afternoon), I spent my remaining time testing for bugs\n                    and bringing my code up to production standards.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Demo Day Prep</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Our code freeze was at 10:30am Wednesday morning. Now that I had a demo-able project, I set about\n                        writing a blog post for the week and a <a>README</a> for MPM<sup>2</sup>. I then began\n                    drafting my speech for our two-minute introduction presentations. We did several rehearsals — and\n                    critiques — on Wednesday, and a final dress rehearsal on Thursday morning.\n                    </p>\n\n                <h3>Demo Day</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around 10am, we went down and began setting up our booths. I borrowed some external speakers to\n                    play my\n                    synth sounds, and set up an external monitor for the visuals. I found that, although the app\n                    worked locally\n                    and could be run on a user's phone, it was much more stable on desktop versions. As such, Ian\n                    offered to let\n                    me use his laptop to demo the user experience. On Ian's laptop, users could control the various\n                    synth and visual parameters. On my laptop, I had the source code and MySQL database, as\n                    well as my blog\n                    and LinkedIn pages available for users to peruse. I also set up a contact sheet, laid out some resumes, and\n                    posted my name on the table!\n                    </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/demo-day-booth.JPG\" alt=\"MPM2 Demo Day Booth\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Ready for Demo Day!</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    Around 11:30am, the guests started to arrive! We then mingled and talked with friends and family\n                    for\n                    about 30 minutes. Waiting was making me a little anxious, so I was glad when the instructors\n                    began\n                    their presentations around noon.

Named parameters have\n                                    an argument name that comes first. In the above example, this means that when we call <code>funcName</code> we would need to\n                                    specify the name of each parameter we give it: <code>funcName(argumentName: \"Some value\")</code>. The{\" \"}\n                                <code>parameterName</code> is the value used within the body of the function.\n                                </li>\n                            <li>\n                                After the argument and parameter names you see <code>: String</code>. This is another interesting difference\n                                between Swift and JavaScript. You declare variable types using a semicolon followed by the variable type (things like:{\" \"}\n                                <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>Array</code>, or <code>Any</code>).\n            Here we are declaring that the parameter type supplied will be a String.\n                                </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Finally, after the parameters, we see <code>-> String</code>. This specifies a return type. Functions in Swift\n                                can either be Void or return a single value (of which you could combine several values in a single, compound{\" \"}\n                                <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple\" title=\"Tuple — Wikipedia page\">tuple</a>).

Sometimes I think that design\n                    is looked at as the least important of a developer’s skill set.\n                    Backend is typically seen as more complex, and is usually more highly\n                    compensated. Kuang and Fabricant’s book has had me thinking a lot\n                    this month about the importance of design.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The first thing that I found interesting is the story of{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.\" title=\"Apple, Inc Wikipedia\">Apple</a>.\n                    When Apple began its rise to world dominance, I was still too young to be\n                    a heavy computer user. It’s interesting because when I say “too young”\n                    I was actually much older than the age that many children today surf\n                    the web and watch Jake Paul vlogs. The difference is that before Apple\n                    ushered in the age of user friendly devices, children did not use computers\n                    at nearly the rate they do today. Since I was too young to really use a\n                    computer before Apple became prominent, I did not really understand the\n                    context in which Apple began making hardware.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Before Apple, computers were powerful machines that required specialized\n                    knowledge to use. They came with large, densely worded manuals, and despite\n                    the fact that they could do many tasks better than old methods, their\n                    difficulty of use prevented them from being nearly as prevalent as they\n                    are today. Apple’s designers strove to create user interfaces that lessened\n                    the difficulty of taking a task from an idea in your head --> to the\n                    interaction with the computer --> to the desired result. The iPhone and\n                    the ability to physically touch and drag objects around the screen really\n                    embodies this ease of use. To move down a page you simply drag down, just\n                    as you would drag a piece of physical paper across a table if you wanted to\n                    move it downward. Apple helped revolutionize the world of intuitive computing.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One aspect that “User Friendly” has had me thinking about is the difference between\n                    UI and UX. UI and UX are often grouped together as UI/UX, and it wasn’t until recently\n                    that I started thinking about their differences. UI stands for User Interface, and I\n                    think this is what most people think about when they imagine a designer. UI includes\n                    aspects such as color, layout, and aesthetics. UX stands for User Experience, and may\n                    have very little to do with visual design, but rather with how a human interacts with\n                    an object. UX involves thinking about how a designer can help make using a device as\n                    intuitive as possible. UI and UX can be completely independent of each other. Imagine\n                    you download an app with great UI: the colors are beautiful, there are tons of animations\n                    when you interact with the screen, etc. Now imagine that you start interacting with the\n                    app. You want to move an object from the bottom to the top of the screen. Instinctively,\n                    you click and drag. Nothing happens. Finally, you realize if you tap on the object, a\n                    menu appears. In that menu,  hidden at the bottom of a scrollable list of 20 options,\n                    you finally see “Move”. You tap “Move”, and are taken to a new screen where you are\n                    asked to enter X and Y coordinates for the desired location of the object. Talk about\n                    bad UX. I’m sure you can also imagine a case when an app with minimal User Interface,\n                    could have a great, intuitive User Experience.\n                    </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    For more information on UI and UX, I recommend reading{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/110/1107939/user-friendly/9780753556641.html\" title=\"User Friendly Book Publisher's Page\">“User Friendly”</a>,\n                        or to check out some of Apple’s documentation on{\" \"}\n                    <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/\" title=\"Apple's Human Interface Guidelines\">Human Design Interface Guidelines</a>.\n                    </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default February2020;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction March2020() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Monthly Update</h3>\n                <p>\n                    I realized that my blog post from February didn’t include a Monthly Update.\n                    Before diving into creating an image cache, I wanted to provide an update\n                    on some things I have done in February and March:\n                </p>\n\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        Play Catan (and lose)\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Spend a lot of money on yummy French food for Valentine’s day\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        Participate in\n                        a <a href=\"https://anv4.artbyform.com/\" title=\"FORM's Website\">24-hour song making competition</a>.\n                        My song was 1 of 37 tracks included on the album.

We left for Colorado on March 11th. When we left, there\n                    were 1,215 cases in the US, which was worrisome, but we didn't think it was enough at that point\n                    to cancel our travel plans. Instead, we took lots of hand sanitizer and wipes, and we were careful on\n                    the plane not to touch our faces and to wash our hands regularly.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    During our week in Colorado, things continued to look worse and worse. We woke up in the\n                    hotel room to the news of canceled sporting events, and watched throughout the week as the DOW\n                    dropped nearly 3,000 points. We planned on skiing\n                    for 2-3 days (packing our lunch, washing our hands often). The first day, there were no reports of COVID-19\n                    in Breckenridge. On the second day, we noticed that employees were sanitizing tables and that ski lifts were now\n                    loading only members of the same party. On our third day out there, after the first confirmed cases on COVID-19 were\n                    reported on the mountain, the Governor stepped in and shut down all the ski slopes.\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/ski-trip-lift-policy.JPG\" alt=\"COVID-19 Precautions\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Day 2: Breckenridge institutes a \"Load Related Parties Only\" policy for the ski lifts.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                On a positive note, we really enjoyed seeing <a href=\"\">William</a>! The 2 days that we got on the slopes\n                were awesome. Anna continues to improve as a skier! On only her fourth cumulative ski day,\n                she managed to go down a blue run! After spending the weekend in Breckenridge, we spent a few\n                more days in Denver, mostly in William's apartment due to concerns with COVID-19.\n\n                <br /> <br />\n\n                {/* <!-- Carousel Images --> */}\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/ski-trip-1.JPG\"\n                            alt=\"Anna Skiing\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 bg-dark rounded\">Anna is a quick learner!

Once arriving back in Kentucky, we also decided to quarantine \n                    (with the exception of groceries) for 14 days to ensure that we didn't bring any \n                    sickness back with us.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/ski-trip-driving-home.JPG\" alt=\"Driving home\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Driving home from Colorado.</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <br /> <br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Creating an Image Cache</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    In addition to doing Freelance work, I have also been \n                    spending my time working through \n                    a <a href=\"https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/\" title=\"The Let's Build That App website\">LBTA course on building iOS apps</a>. \n                    The course I am working on walks you through development \n                    of an Instagram clone. My app is only about halfway done, \n                    but I wanted to talk about an image cache feature that I \n                    built this week that I thought seemed really important.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In computing, a cache is a collection of data, stored by the \n                    computer so that future requests for that data can be served \n                    quickly. Here is a possible real world analogy: imagine you \n                    are a police sketch artist. You spend several hours drawing \n                    suspects 1, 2, and 3. The next day, your star witness \n                    eliminates drawings of suspects 1 and 2. Do you throw away \n                    drawings 1 and 2 immediately? Perhaps not. If your star \n                    witness changes their mind, you would have to redraw suspects \n                    1 and 2. This would result in a lot of duplicated work. \n                    Rather, it might be better to store these drawings, at least \n                    for a little while, as the case progresses.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Computer programs do something similar. In my Instagram app, \n                    I have a “home feed” of images from users that I follow. When \n                    I scroll from top to bottom, any image that I scroll past, the app has to load \n                    from <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\" title=\"Firebase Website\">Firebase</a>. \n                    When I scroll past an image, should my app forget the data from that image? If \n                    so, when I scroll back to the top of my feed, my app will have to load all of \n                    those images again. That’s a lot of extra work. Instead, my app can cache those \n                    previously loaded images, storing them out of sight in case they are needed \n                    again in the future.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\" style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\" }}>\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/robbie-instagram-clone-home-feed.png\" alt=\"Instagram Clone Home Feed\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The \"Home Feed\" of my Instagram app clone.</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                    There are two main reasons why caching is helpful. First, it \n                    decreases data usage. If someone has a limited data plan, they \n                    don’t want to burn through data just to see photos their device \n                    should already have loaded. Second, it increases speed. If a user's \n                    device is on a relatively slow internet connection, they may have \n                    to wait for each file to load. Once the file is loaded, it would be \n                    wasteful for the device to delete the file if there is a reasonable \n                    expectation that the user will access it again soon.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">My Image Cache Code</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Below is an image of my image cache code:\n                </p>\n\n                <figure className=\"figure\">\n                    <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/image-cache-code.png\" alt=\"Image Cache Code\" />\n                    <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">The code for fetching images from Firebase — includes a cache function (lines 21-24).</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n\n                <p>\n                    This code is for a <code>CustomImageView</code> class, an \n                    extension of <code>UIImageView</code>. This custom class allows \n                    me to call a <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> method on an image view, that loads \n                    an image from Firebase and sets the image view image equal to that loaded image. \n                    This abstracts away a lot of repetitive code as I have to load images \n                    from Firebase in several places throughout my Instagram app.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    On line 11 I declare an <code>imageCache</code> variable. \n                    Since <code>imageCache</code> is declared outside \n                    of our custom class, it is available throughout our entire code \n                    base. <code>imageCache</code> is a dictionary of key-value pairs, \n                    with the keys being Strings and the values being \n                    of the type <code>UIImage</code>. The way key-value pairs work in a dictionary is similar \n                    to how a real world, paper dictionary works: a word (the key) is paired with a \n                    definition (the value). For example, lets say you created a dictionary called colors: \n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"text-center\">\n                    <code>colors[\"blue\": \"the color of water\", \"red\": \"the color of fire\"]</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    If you called <code>colors[\"blue\"]</code> the output would be: <code>\"the color of water\"</code>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Our code works just like this! The block of code from lines 30 \n                    to 46 fetches our images from Firebase. After fetching the images, \n                    it adds the fetched image to the <code>imageCache</code> dictionary \n                    using the key value of the image's download url String. Let's say for example that \n                    the first image we download has a download url of <code>\"xyz\"</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    The next time <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> is called, it \n                    will run a test on line 21 to see if the image we are about to download is \n                    already in our cache. If this is a new image (for example, if we have scrolled \n                    down on our feed) with a download url of <code>abc</code>, then the check of \n                    <code>imageCache[\"abc\"]</code> will return <code>nil</code> and the code continues \n                    on to lines 26 and below — fetching this new image from Firebase and adding it \n                    to our cache.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Lets say that we now scroll back up on our feed. <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> is \n                    called again, and on line 21, we check to see if the first image with a download \n                    url of <code>\"xyz\"</code> is in our cache. Since it is indeed in our image, we \n                    now enter our conditional block on line 22, setting the <code>CustomImageView</code>'s image \n                    to the cached image (ie. using the cached image as the image to display in the app). \n                    On line 23, we then <code>return</code> out of the <code>.loadImage(urlString: String)</code> method, \n                    never allowing our code to reach lines 30-46 where we would have made an unnecessary \n                    Firebase call.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Hopefully I have managed to explain why using caches are useful, and \n                    shown a simple example of how to implement one in your code!\n                </p>\n\n                {/* <!-- White space --> */}\n                <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />\n\n            </article >\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default March2020;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Button } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction April2020() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Monthly Update</h3>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Highlights from April: Anna borrowed her Dad’s lawn mower.\n                    We are now proud lawn mowers!\n                </p>\n\n                <video width=\"100%\" controls>\n                    <source src=\"/blogAssets/video/anna-mowing-the-lawn.MOV\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n                    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n                </video>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Anna's job as a Healthcare Technician has gotten significantly more\n                    stressful as she has gotten pulled to a COVID-19 floor for the past\n                    3 shifts.

The course took a long time to work through —\n                    over 16 hours of content, and since I paused often to code along or look things up,\n                    I’m sure that time was at least doubled. Below is a video walkthrough of my completed app.\n                    I can’t recommend LBTA enough.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\">\n                    <iframe className=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcsI42rxDQs\" title=\"Instagram Clone Demo Video\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    My next project was to create an app — something relatively\n                    original — and attempt to take it from conception all the way\n                    through to being published on the app store.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Step 1 of course was handing over the $99 to join the Apple developer program...\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    With my wallet now slightly lighter, it was time to decide\n                    what kind of app I wanted to create. I really like photography,\n                    and since I had already learned how to create a custom camera\n                    interface in the LBTA Instagram course, I decided I would try to\n                    make a glitch camera app.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I wanted the interface to be simple. The user loads the app,\n                    opening with the camera already activated. The only control\n                    is the shutter button. Once the user takes a photo, they can\n                    save it or delete it and try again. As an additional bit of\n                    flair, I wanted the camera shutter button to animate in and out,\n                    to make the app feel a bit more alive. The graphic for the camera\n                    shutter was made from a photo taken by the app.\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure border\" style={{ maxWidth: \"50%\", margin: \"auto\" }}>\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/appAssets/img/glch-saved-message.PNG\" alt=\"Generated with the Glch App\" />\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    There are no controls that the user can manipulate. The effect\n                    that the user gets is random and unexpected.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Building the effects was where things started to get more challenging.\n                    I used Core Image filters to create the distorted effects. These often\n                    had their parameters maxed out far beyond their intended ranges, or\n                    were chained one after another to create interesting effects. Currently,\n                    the app has 14 different effects.\n                </p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Creating a Core Image Filter</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Creating a Core Image filter is actually fairly simple.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    In the Glch app, I am using UIImageViews. Step one is\n                    to convert the <code>UIImageView.image</code> into\n                    a <code>cgImage</code> (Core Graphics Image). In the example \n                    below, <code>imageView</code> is a parameter containing \n                    the <code>UIImageView</code> that I have passed into my function:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}guard let cgImage = imageView.image?.cgImage else &#123;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}print(\"Failed to create CG Image.\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}return UIImage()<br />\n                        {\"    \"}&#125;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}let ciImage = CIImage(cgImage: cgImage)<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    Now that I have my <code>cgImage</code>, I can begin creating image \n                    filters:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}let filter = CIFilter(name: \"CIExposureAdjust\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: \"inputImage\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter?.setValue(NSNumber(1.5), forKey: \"inputEV\")<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    The <code>CIFilter</code> allows you to create a filter by setting \n                    its <code>\"name\"</code> property. You can find a list of all of the \n                    available <code>CIFilters</code> in \n                    the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/\">Apple Documentation</a>. \n                    I next pass the <code>cgImage</code> into the filter by setting the filter \n                    value, with a key of <cdoe>\"inputImage\"</cdoe>. Finally, I adjust the filter \n                    parameter by again setting the filter, but this time with a key value \n                    of <code>\"inputEV\"</code>.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    From here, one option would be to continue to chain together more <code>CGFilters</code>. To \n                    do this you simply add another filter, but instead of passing in our \n                    original <code>cgImage</code>, we pass in the output of our first \n                    filter, <code>filter?.outputImage</code>. Example:\n                </p>\n                \n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}let filter2 = CIFilter(name: \"CIColorMonochrome\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}filter2?.setValue(filter?.outputImage, forKey: \"inputImage\")<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    When you are done chaining together filters, you may now want \n                    to output a <code>UIImage</code>. To do this, you first \n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}guard let outputImage = filter?.outputImage else &#123;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}print(\"Failed to create Output Image.\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}return UIImage()<br />\n                        {\"    \"}&#125;<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    This extracts the processed <code>cgImage</code> from our filter. \n                    Next we need to create a <code>CIContext</code> (Core Image Context) for \n                    rendering our UIImage:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}let context = CIContext()<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    Finally, we will generate a <code>UIImage</code> containing \n                    our processed image:\n                </p>\n\n                <code>\n                    <pre>\n                        {\"    \"}if let cgimg = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) &#123;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}let processedImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgimg, scale: 1, orientation: .right)<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}return processedImage<br />\n                        {\"    \"}&#125; else &#123;<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}print(\"Failed to return image.\")<br />\n                        {\"    \"}{\"    \"}return UIImage()<br />\n                        {\"    \"}&#125;<br />\n                    </pre>\n                </code>\n\n                <p>\n                    This section of code first checks to see if we can use \n                    our <code>CIContext</code> to create a <code>cgImage</code>. \n                    On line 2, we the create a <code>UIImage</code> from \n                    the <code>CGImage</code>, with a scale of 1, and orientated to \n                    the right. We then return this <code>UIImage</code> out of our \n                    effect function. If we are unable to create our processed image, our \n                    conditional statement fails and we print an error message and \n                    output an empty <code>UIImage</code>.\n                </p>\n  \n                <p>\n                    You can download a Beta version of the app below, or\n                    check out the app’s landing page for more information!\n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"text-center\">\n                    <Button href=\"/apps/glch\" className=\"m-3\">\n                        Glch App\n                    </Button>\n                    <Button href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/1ZTQ3ZSX\" className=\"m-3\">\n                        Download Glch Beta\n                    </Button>\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n            </article>\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default April2020;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Table } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction May2020() {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <article className=\"text-justify\">\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Since graduating from\n                    the <a href=\"https://www.awesomeinc.org/bootcamp\">Awesome Inc Bootcamp</a> in\n                    December, I have been trying to fill in some of my computer science knowledge gaps —\n                    things I would have learned had I gotten a CS Degree.

A useful way to send a signal through \n                    a computer is using electrical impulses. Impulse off: 0. Impulse on: 1. \n                    A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor\">transistor </a> in \n                    a computer can store billions of these impulses, allowing the computer \n                    to store large amounts of information.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A group of 8 bits is called a byte. When you hear about your computer \n                    having 1 Gigabyte (Gb) of memory, this means that it can store 1 billion \n                    bytes (or 8 billion bits). \n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    Since a byte contains 8 bits, it can store values from 0 \n                    (00000000) up to 255 (11111111). Since 8 digits are hard to \n                    read and write, computer scientists often use a Base-16 system \n                    of counting called Hexadecimal, using the digits 0-9 A-F. The is \n                    useful because a byte can now be expressed with just two digits. \n                    To notate Hexadecimal, it is useful to prefix it with 0x:\n                </p>\n\n                <Table>\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Decimal</th>\n                            <th>Binary</th>\n                            <th>Hexadecimal</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                    <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">0</th>\n                            <td><code>00000000</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x00</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">10</th>\n                            <td><code>00001010</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x0A</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">15</th>\n                            <td><code>00001111</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0x0F</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th scope=\"row\">255</th>\n                            <td><code>11111111</code></td>\n                            <td><code>0xFF</code></td>\n                        </tr>\n                    </tbody>\n                </Table>\n\n                <p>\n                    You can begin building text documents and images using binary.\n                </p>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Text From Binary</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    You create text from binary using a character encoding standard \n                    called <a href=\"http://www.asciitable.com/\">ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)</a>.

If you \n                    zoom in enough on a digital image, you will eventually see pixilation, \n                    where the photo starts to look blurry as individual pixels appear.

I am hoping to streamline \n                            my blog writing a little bit by writing a utility program.\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    I'm exciting to be posting on this site again!

I remember initially hoping that the lockdowns would only last a few weeks, and that as the weather warmed up, that hopefully we wouldn't be locked down all summer. Writing this in 2023, this is a little funny as the lockdowns lasted for years, and I still sometimes wear a mask in public places.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    One thing that was really reassuring was watching governor Beshear's daily press updates. We would make some snacks and tune in for updates on the pandemic.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/lockdown-life-1.JPG\" alt=\"Watch Beshear's updates\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Cheese plate and updates from Andy!</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/lockdown-life-2.JPG\" alt=\"Scrabble\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Playing games during the lockdown</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n                <br />\n\n                <br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Spring</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    I spent much of the spring and early summer job hunting. During the beginning of the year, I did freelance iOS development on UpWork for a local client. Sometime around March I landed my first (small) client. During all of this, I was sending out job applications for software jobs. I kept a detailed spreadsheet of my job hunt. Over 7 months (Nov 2019 - May 2020), I applied for 61 jobs. From that, I got 8 interviews. One turned into the UpWork freelance work and (finally) in May, I landed a full time tech job. I applied to several companies on multiple occasions (no, not spamming them -- these were separate posting over a period of months). I ended up applying to VetData 4 times and interviewing for 2 roles before finally receiving an offer.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    It took me a while to land in tech. I was originally supposed to graduate from Centre in 2015. I took an extra year to add courses in Music. I spent a few years after graduating working odd jobs and doing a lot of creative work in music, filmmaking, and photography (2016-2019). My parents were always super supportive of this, but I imagine that they must have been worried about what direction my career would take (they never told me this, but I was certainly worried, so I'm guessing everyone around me worried too). After graduating from Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp in December 2019, my parents new I was job hunting but I kept things pretty quite. After getting my QA offer at VetData, I asked to come over for dinner and surprised them with my offer letter. Below is a picture of us celebrating.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    My job at VetData was remote (eventually there was an option to go into the Lexington office, but people rarely went in). I have also included a picture of my remote work setup, taken the weekend before my first day.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/getting-a-job.JPG\" alt=\"VetData offer letter\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">My parents and I celebrating me getting a real job</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/first-day-of-work.JPG\" alt=\"Remote work setup\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">My remote work setup</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <br /><br />\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-center\">Summer</h3>\n\n                <p>\n                    Onboarding onto a new role remotely was a little challenging. The first few days were both exciting but also involved all day Zoom calls, and these were a little draining.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    A perk of working from home during the summer was that I spent my lunch breaks going for walks or relaxing in the backyard. That summer, I listened to a podcast featuring Naval. Naval talked about meditation (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856?lang=en\">a different Naval thread on meditation</a>). My understanding was that meditation didn't require any sort of guidance, and that you just spent some time doing nothing. To me, it made sense that we are constantly bombarded with input: social media, books, work, conversations and that our brain never has down time. It seemed like every second we are either consuming media or listening to music or talking to someone. Our brain is constantly in taking, and is never given a chance to process. In my opinion, that's why the few times without input (driving, showering, falling asleep), it felt like I always had a lot on my mind. All this is to say, that I was surprised to find that when I just spent some time doing \"nothing\", I was never board -- it seemed like my brain liked having some space to catch up on all that information I was feeding it. Naval referred to this input as an email inbox and if we spend enough time doing nothing, we might eventually process everything that is on our mind. *Phew* sorry for the rant.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/backyard-meditation.JPG\" alt=\"Robbie in the backyard\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Lunch break in the backyard</ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    We also took advantage of the summer weather and threw a dinner party. Yes that is our kitchen table on the back porch -- this was a season of life without much furniture and we had no dedicated outdoor pieces. It looks like Anna made us some yummy ramen. We did a lot of cooking that summer. I was really into <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqJQ_cXSat0KIAVfIfKkVA\">J.

I had ambitious plans to do this more than once, but I never got around to it. I didn't sleep that well but it was nice to be outside. I built a fire and went to sleep under the stars and woke up to the sunrise.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div className=\"text-center\">\n                    <figure className=\"figure\">\n                        <img className=\"img-fluid\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/backyard-camping.JPG\" alt=\"Backyard camping\" />\n                        <figcaption className=\"figure-caption text-center\">Roughing it</ figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    Finally, in July we also took our annual family trip to Vermont.

On Sunday, we got brunch with one of my coworkers, Audrey. Three months into my job, I had finally met a coworker in person!\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <Carousel>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/cincy-nursing-exam-1.JPG\" alt=\"A house picture\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Grandma's family home in Cincinatti</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/cincy-nursing-exam-2.JPG\" alt=\"A house picture\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Grandpa's family home in Northern Kentucky</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/cincy-nursing-exam-3.JPG\" alt=\"Brunch\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Brunch with Audrey and her husband</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/blogAssets/img/2020/cincy-nursing-exam-4.JPG\" alt=\"Nursing license email\" />\n                        <Carousel.Caption>\n                            <p className=\"d-inline-flex px-2 mb-4 bg-dark rounded\">Anna gets her RN!!!</p>\n                        </Carousel.Caption>\n                    </Carousel.Item>\n                </Carousel>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <p>\n                    In my <a href=\"mar-2020\">March 2020 blog post</a>, I talked about how excited we were to start a garden.

My grandfather (Bob)'s Mom (Jane) was into family history and had many boxes as pictures, documents, and written notes. That day, we took those boxes out and looked through them. I am also very interested in family history and I was asked if I wanted to start going through those boxes. I felt a little overwhelmed by the amount in the boxes, and thought that I would need to dedicate a time to come over and talk to my grandfather about everything in there. I decided to spend a lot of time that day looking over stuff and I really wish I had. He seemed so healthy then and I didn't know that he would be gone soon.

It was probably a good thing that we did our party remote because on Christmas day, we all started to lose our sense of taste and smell and a few days later, tested positive for Covid. We were lucky that our symptoms were mostly mild (Dad was the sickest with flu-like symptoms). In a way, it meant that we all spent a few more days celebrating the holidays together. The downside was that Anna (thankfully) did not catch Covid but had to spend the holidays away from us.\n                </p>\n\n                <br />\n\n                <div
