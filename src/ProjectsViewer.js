                            In order to both help onboard Swift 5, and make me more comfortable working 
                            in Xcode/iOS simulators, I created an emulation of the Facebook homepage. I called 
                            my version of the app "Robbiebook".

                            For the Phone Simulator, I combined 6 projects that we worked on during
                            the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. The Phone Simulator displays the
                            current time at the top of the "screen". Below that, there is a weather
                            module that pulls realtime weather data based on your current location.
                            Below the weather app is a countdown timer (currently set to countdown
                            to my birthday â€” March 21st). Below the countdown timer are three
                            applications: Calculator, Todo List, and Mind Reader.

                            use <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" title="React Hooks Documentation">React Hooks</a>, as
                            these are a feature of React that I was previously not too familiar with.

                            Built a website and checkout system for a fictional library.
                            Used foreign keys to link between tables, allowing book and
                            user data to be connected. Allowed users to sign-up for an account.
                            Gave librarians the ability to add books to the database. Books can be
                            added manually or by using searching 
                            the <a href="https://developers.google.com/books">Google Books API</a>.
                            Librarians can checkout or return books by entering the books ISBN
                            number, and the user's username. Checked out books appear in red on 
                            the view all books page. Utilized
                            the seven <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/21">RESTful controller actions</a> and

                            Used the <a href="https://entree-f18.herokuapp.com/">Random Menu Generator API</a> to 
                            get a list of random menu items, and then pulled both a title and a description from
                            that JSON file. Generated random menu prices and included a parameter for low, medium,
                            and high price range items. Menu items are stored in Local Storage,
                            allowing for menu consistency across page loads (restaurant name, operating 
                            hours, and item prices are not saved to Local Storage and will reload upon each page load).

                            name of the tile, and the tile's current location on the board. Users 
                            can upload their own image or use the provided default image.

                            Created a calculator app that can perform various mathematical functions.
                            Dynamically rendered the HTML elements using JS. The most challenging
                            aspect was dealing with various "edge-case" scenarios. The calculator would
                            work pretty well if users performed a basic math function (ex. 5 + 3), then 
                            cleared the memory ("C" button), and then performed another basic math 
                            function. A real world user, however, would likely use the calculator in 
                            many different ways. There were a multitude of orders in which the user 
                            might press various buttons. Additionally, there had to be ways of dealing with
                            inputs that didn't make much sense at all (ex. What would happen if the
                            user inputted: + - 53 + / 4 - 4?). And the final (and perhaps most difficult)
                            part of dealing with edge-cases was getting to a point where you had several 
                            fixes for very specific situations, and then had to try to not break any of 
                            those old fixes whenever you implemented a fix for a new scenario.

                            setup. Includes a reset button that allows the board to be reset. After at
