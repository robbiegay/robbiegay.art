                            In order to better understand Swift and mobile app development, I created a clone of 
                            the Instagram app, with backend data being stored on Firebase. Similar to the actual 
                            Instagram app, there is a Home feed where users can scroll through and view posts from 
                            users that they follow. In this feed, users can like, unlike and comment on posts. There is 
                            also a Capture Photo button that utilizes 
                            the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation" title="AVFoundation Documentation Page">AVFoundation framework</a> to 
                            build a custom camera interface to capture and save new photos. The Search page allows users to search for 
                            and follow and unfollow users. The Home feed has a drag-to-update feature to reflect changes in 
                            users that they follow. The Photo Selector controller utilizes 
                            the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit" title="PhotoKit Documentation Page">PhotoKit SDK</a> to 
                            create a page for selecting photos from your camera roll. The selected photo can then be 
                            shared to your profile. Finally, users can visit their Profile page where they can view 
                            the number of posts they have shared, users that they follow, and users that follow 
                            them. Users can toggle between viewing their posts in a grid or list view. Users can 
                            logout from their Profile page. When no one is logged into the app, users are 
                            prompted to login or create a profile.

                            In the Spring of 2020, I worked as a part of a team developing an app called Moolathon. 
                            Moolathon is a fitness fundraising app, where users raise money by running more miles. 
                            I helped create a feature where users could turn a workout summary into an easily shareable 
                            post for social media. Moolathon was released on the Apple App store in March of 2020.

                            In late February, I decided it was finally time to upgrade my website. 
                            I built <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/">my old website</a> early on in 
                            the Bootcamp, and since I have learned several new frameworks and libraries since then, 
                            I thought it would be best to rebuild from the ground up. This iteration of my website is built 
                            using Bootstrap and React.js for the front end. The page navigation is run through 
                            React Router. For the homepage, I wanted to do something that both showcased some technical 
                            skill in Web Developer, as well as something creative from my background 
                            in the arts. I created a homepage that animates through a range of "sunrise-ey" colors, and which 
                            increases in luminosity as the user moves their mouse vertically from the bottom to the 
                            top of the page.

                            To help learn basic iOS app development, I wanted to create a iOS version of a web based 
                            app I had previously completed. During the Awesome Inc Bootcamp, I built 
                            a <a href="https://robbiegay.github.io/calculator/" title="Live demo of my JS Calculator">calculator app</a> using 
                            JavaScript. I wanted to be able to compare the JavScript and Swift syntax. I used 
                            Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit" title="UIKit Documentation Page">UIKit framework</a> to 
                            build the various buttons and displays and used Robert-Hein 
                            Hooijmans's <a href="https://github.com/roberthein/TinyConstraints">TinyConstraints</a> as 
                            syntactic sugar for Auto Layout.

                            For the Phone Simulator, I combined 6 projects that we worked on during
                            the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. The Phone Simulator displays the
                            current time at the top of the "screen". Below that, there is a weather
                            module that pulls realtime weather data based on your current location.
                            Below the weather app is a countdown timer (currently set to countdown
                            to my birthday â€” March 21st). Below the countdown timer are three
                            applications: Calculator, Todo List, and Mind Reader.

                            For this project, I wanted to 
                            use <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" title="React Hooks Documentation">React Hooks</a>, as
                            these are a feature of React that I was previously not too familiar with.

                            Prior to the Fall 2019 Bootcamp, I spent several years making electronic music and, 
                            for the past year, hosted a talk show on WRFL interviewing music makers. For my 
                            final project, I wanted to do something that combined my love of digital music 
                            with the Full Stack technologies that we learned in the course. MPMÂ² is an 
                            interactive art installation that allows up to 7 users to control various 
                            pitch and tone aspects of an online synthesizer. Users use their mobile phones 
                            to modify their respective parameter. The sounds generated cause the main screenâ€™s 
                            visuals to change.

                            Gave librarians the ability to add books to the database. Books can be

                            Built a website for a fictional restaurant located at Awesome Inc!
                            Used the <a href="https://entree-f18.herokuapp.com/">Random Menu Generator API</a> to 
                            get a list of random menu items, and then pulled both a title and a description from
                            that JSON file. Generated random menu prices and included a parameter for low, medium,
                            and high price range items. Menu items are stored in Local Storage,
                            allowing for menu consistency across page loads (restaurant name, operating 
                            hours, and item prices are not saved to Local Storage and will reload upon each page load).

                            Built a Sliding Puzzle game that allows users to rearrange a 4x4 grid
                            of tiles to create a completed image. Built using an object-oriented
                            approach, using an array of objects to store information such as the 
                            name of the tile, and the tile's current location on the board. Users 
                            can upload their own image or use the provided default image.

                            Created a calculator app that can perform various mathematical functions.
                            Dynamically rendered the HTML elements using JS. The most challenging
                            aspect was dealing with various "edge-case" scenarios. The calculator would
                            work pretty well if users performed a basic math function (ex. 5 + 3), then 
                            cleared the memory ("C" button), and then performed another basic math 
                            function. A real world user, however, would likely use the calculator in 
                            many different ways. There were a multitude of orders in which the user 
                            might press various buttons. Additionally, there had to be ways of dealing with
                            inputs that didn't make much sense at all (ex. What would happen if the
                            user inputted: + - 53 + / 4 - 4?). And the final (and perhaps most difficult)
                            part of dealing with edge-cases was getting to a point where you had several 
                            fixes for very specific situations, and then had to try to not break any of 
                            those old fixes whenever you implemented a fix for a new scenario.

                            Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two users to play against each
                            other. Used nested arrays to test win conditions against the current board
                            setup. Includes a reset button that allows the board to be reset. After at 
                            least 1 game has been played, a tally appears that keeps track of X wins, 
                            O wins and ties.
