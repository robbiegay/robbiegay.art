                    I’m drafting this post at 10:43pm on March 20th, 2023. I have about 77 minutes left in my 20’s. I’ve been dreading turning 30 all year -- maybe even for several years.
                </p>

                <div className="text-center">

                    Somewhat surprisingly, a thing that Mike Posner says has been on my mind. I've always thought of Mike Posner as one of many many American pop stars -- His music is good but I never really admired him personally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then I found his YouTube channel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2019, Posner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXeZNXdu-gs">walked across the United States</a>. Walked. It took him almost a year. In 2021, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdfgV-ZCnYw">climbed Mount Everest</a>. He summited 71 mountains around the world in order to prepare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Walking across the country is hard. Summiting mount Everest is hard. Hard work that someone like Mike Posner probably doesn't need to do. I don't know his financial situation, but his videos show sold out shows and he has millions of subscribers on his YouTube channel. I imagine his life could be easier than climbing mountains and walking across continents. I imagine it could be private jets and pool parties in vegas; expensive houses (maybe a few) and cars a non-car guy like me wouldn't recognize. It seems like Mike Posner has a choice between something easy and something hard -- something pretty good or something truly fulfilling, and he has chosen to do the hard work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my own life, I feel like I often have a choice between what is easy and comfortable and what is fulfilling and meaningful. This weekend, I was thinking about these tradeoffs:
                <ul>
                        <li>
                            I love being up early -- I hate waking up early; I have trouble falling asleep early.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I love being outside at night -- In the evening, the coach is more comfortable and the TV has a lot of appeal.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    I often choose the extra sleep over the sunrise and a Netflix show over looking at the stars. Sometimes I let the weather be an excuse: It is March and we've only had a few days of nice weather so far this year. Tonight, it is 37°. I am writing this on my front porch -- I have sweats and a heavy jacket on. I'm a little uncomfortable, but am actually having a really good time.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    My list of excuses is pretty small. I have a flexible job — if I want to do something in the morning, I can get to work later and stay late. If I want to travel and work remote, I can travel and work remote. Financially, I can afford a few additional expenses here and there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is one thing to know that you don’t have the time, flexibility, or resources to do things that make your life more fulfilling. It is a little more depressing to know that you chose creature comforts over a meaningful life. Perhaps the meaningful life that I am looking for was described by Henry David Thoreau 170 years ago:

                            "I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms."

                <p>
                    TV and social media feel like the <i>not life</i> Thoreau was talking about. Sometimes even books feel like the <i>not life</i>. Life feels like pre-dawn walks and sitting in your backyard under the stars. Life feels like playing board games with your friends or using your body to hike, run, climb, or play a sport. Life feels like sitting still, doing nothing -- doing nothing, which is such an un-American, non-activity: You can't write end-of-year lists of the best "nothing" to do it your city. You can't sell it or put it on billboards. But sometimes the <i>nothing</i> feels like "[putting] to rout" all of that <i>not life</i> that HDT wrote about 130 years before the social media and the internet.

                    Going back to that thing that I said Mike Posner said: he ends <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2CwZ1UTSSA">several of his videos</a> with a lyric:
                </p>

                            "Beginnings always hide themselves in endings.”

                <p>
                    As my 20’s draw to a close (I now have 63 minutes left), I am looking forward to making small changes that choose the meaningful over the easy. I hope to take advantage of the flexibility that this season of my life affords, and to do the hard work of living a good life.

                    Update: I Turned 30
                </h3>

                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    It is now 11:28pm on March 21st. I've had a really great day celebrating my new decade with friends and family. Anna was out the door early to get us bagels and doughnuts. At work and at the gym, I got to make lots of lame jokes about how I'm turing into an old man (typically, the people older then me were the ones who found these jokes the least amusing). After the gym (and 30 birthday burpees), Anna and I met up with my parents and Grandma Emily at <a href="https://www.italx.com/">ItalX</a> for a really nice dinner (I got the Gnudi di Zucca -- it was delicious). After dinner, we came back to our house for dessert: pecan pie from <a href="https://missyspieshop.com/">Missy's</a> (it was also very good; after this week, I would be okay if I never had sugar again). William and his roommates videocalled in for a verse of Happy Birthday.
