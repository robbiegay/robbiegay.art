                    After a few years off from posting to my blog, I am writing a series of "year in review" posts and am planning to start posting regularly again.

                <h3 className="text-center">Winter</h3>

                <p>
                    I wrote monthly blog posts in 2020 from January through May, and those posts included some updates for January - March:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="jan-2020">January updates</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="mar-2020">February and March updates</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    After getting back from Colorado, Anna and I we entered life in the Covid lockdown. I remember initially hoping that the lockdown would only last a few weeks. I was hopeful that as the weather warmed up, that we wouldn't be locked down all summer. This is a little bit funny as the lockdowns lasted for several years, and even in 2023 I still sometimes wear a mask in public places.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing that was really reassuring during this stressful time was watching governor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear">Andy Beshear's</a> daily press updates. We would make some snacks and tune in for news about the pandemic.

                <h3 className="text-center">Spring</h3>

                <p>
                    I spent the spring and early summer job hunting. At the beginning of the year, I did freelance iOS development on UpWork for a local client. Sometime around March, I landed my first (small) freelance client. During all of this, I was sending out job applications for software jobs. I kept a detailed spreadsheet of my job hunt. Over 7 months (Nov 2019 - May 2020), I applied for 61 jobs. From that, I got 8 interviews. One turned into the UpWork freelance work and then  (finally) in May, I landed a full time tech job! I applied to several companies on multiple occasions (these were separate posting over a period of months). I ended up applying to VetData 4 times and interviewing for 2 roles before finally receiving an offer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It took me a while to land in tech. I was originally supposed to graduate from <a href="https://www.centre.edu/">Centre</a> in 2015. I took an extra year to add courses in Music. I spent a few years after graduating working odd jobs and doing a lot of creative work in music, filmmaking, and photography (2016-2019). My parents were always super supportive of this, but I imagine that they must have been worried about what direction my career would take (they never told me this, but I was certainly worried, so I'm guessing everyone around me worried too). After graduating from Awesome Inc's coding bootcamp in December of 2019, my parents knew that I was job hunting but I kept things pretty quiet. After getting my QA offer at VetData, I asked to come over for dinner and surprised them with my offer letter! Below is a picture of us celebrating.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My job at VetData was remote (eventually there was an option to go into the Lexington office, but people rarely worked in person). I have included a picture of my remote work setup, taken the weekend before my first day.

                <h3 className="text-center">Summer</h3>

                <p>
                    Onboarding onto a new role remotely was a little challenging. The first few days were both exciting and exhausting. The all day Zoom calls were a little draining but I was really excited about the new job.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A perk of working from home during the summer was that I spent my lunch breaks going for walks or relaxing in the backyard. That summer, I listened to a podcast featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant">Naval</a>. Naval talked about meditation (<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856?lang=en">a different Naval thread on meditation</a>). From that podcast, my understanding was that meditation didn't need to be guided and that it could be as simple as sitting somewhere and letting your mind wander -- ie just doing nothing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rational behind this had to do with the inputs and outputs of our brain. We are constantly feeding our brain new information: we check our phones when we are bored, we listen to music in the car, we read books or watch TV at home. This is more stimulation and information then our caveman brain ever had. With all of this input, when to we give ourselves time to process and make sense of this information? Naval compared meditation to an email inbox -- we have all of these thoughts to process and as we spend time "doing nothing", we begin to process this backlog of thoughts. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    All of that is to say is that when I spent some time hanging out in the backyard, I expected to be bored. Instead, I was surprised to find that I always had stuff to thing about.

                    We also took advantage of the summer weather and threw a dinner party! Yes that is our kitchen table on the back porch -- this was a season of life without much furniture and we had no dedicated outdoor pieces. It looks like Anna made us some yummy ramen. We did a lot of cooking that summer. I was really into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqJQ_cXSat0KIAVfIfKkVA">J. Kenji López-Alt</a> and made a lot of his recipes that summer.

                    In July, I ordered a "dumb" phone. This was part on my continued efforts to break my addiction to my phone. I wanted to turn my phone off but was worried about not having a phone in case of emergency.

                <p>
                    I also decided to camp in the backyard. I had ambitions to do this more than once, but I never got around to it. I didn't sleep that well but it was nice to be outside. I built a fire and went to sleep under the stars and woke up to the sunrise and the sound of the courthouse clock chiming on the hour.

                    In July, we took our annual family trip to Vermont. This was one of my favorite trips up there. We had a large group and it was my grandfathers last trip with us.

                    A few weeks later, we traveled up to Cincinnati for Anna's NCLEX exam. While Anna was taking her test, I got in touch with my roots -- my maternal grandparents grew up in Cincinnati (grandma) and Northern Kentucky (grandpa). I drove by both of their family homes. On Sunday, we got brunch with one of my coworkers, Audrey. Three months into my job, I had finally met a coworker in person!

                    In my <a href="mar-2020">March 2020 blog post</a>, I talked about how excited we were to start a garden. We started our seeds inside before planting them in the backyard. For several months, we watered every day and weeded weekly. And I must say... it paid off! We actually had a pretty nice garden that summer!

                    The remaining two summers that we lived in the house, we planted our garden each Spring and ignored it all Summer. Those years we grew nothing but weeds.

                    In September, we had my grandparents over for dinner! I might be acting a little bit sentimental, but my grandfather ended up passing away about a year after this dinner, and this was a really nice evening that Anna and I had with Bob and Judi. I think we served some J Kenji Tuscan White Bean and Parmesan Soup (from his book <a href="http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/books">The Food Lab</a>). We used some rosemary from our garden and ate outside.

                    We spent labor day with family and friends on Lake Herrington. I'm not a big lake person, but everyone having their boats next to each other was pretty fun!

                    In October, Anna and I went to visit William in Denver. William and I did some long boarding around the city. It was a really fun way to explore. I fell off the board a few times but managed to stumble and stay on my feet each time. When Anna arrived mid-trip, we explored Denver some more and drove into the mountains to do some hiking.

                    On November 4th, Anna's Dad passed away unexpectedly. Tom was a really great man who we have both missed over the last few years. He was a great cook and I always enjoyed when Anna would invite me over for family dinner. He made a delicious rendition of the <a href="https://www.wallacestation.com/#menu">Wallace Station</a> Merv's Hot Ham and Jalapeno sandwich. I know that it has been really tough on Anna and I wish I could do more to help her.

                    In addition to the regular holiday stuff, there was a day in December where we went over to my grandparent's house in Lawrenceburg. My grandfather (Bob's) mom (Jane) was into family history and had many boxes as pictures, documents, and written notes. That day, we took those boxes out and looked through them. I am also very interested in family history and I was asked if I wanted to start going through those boxes. I felt a little overwhelmed by the amount in the boxes, and thought that I would need to dedicate a time to come over and talk to my grandfather about everything in there. I declined to spend a lot of time that day looking over stuff and I really wish I had. He seemed so healthy then and I didn't know that he would be gone soon.

                    Living so close, I saw my grandfather a lot so I don't have many regrets and am actually pretty grateful for the time we had together. I never did look through that box with him though and its something I regret.

                    We held our annual family Christmas party in mid December. Due to Covid, we decided to do a "drive by" party. Everyone came by in their cars, we wished them a Happy Holiday, and gave them some Christmas treats. It was probably a good thing that we did our party remote because on Christmas day, we all started to lose our sense of taste and smell. A few days later, we tested positive for Covid. We were lucky that our symptoms were mostly mild (Dad was the sickest with flu-like symptoms). In a way, it meant that we all spent a few more days celebrating the holidays together.

                    Anna worked over the holidays and was not around us enough to catch Covid. This was good for her health but also a little sad because while we quarantined together, she was alone for the week between Christmas and New Years.
