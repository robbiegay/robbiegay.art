                <p>
                    During the Awesome Inc bootcamp in 2019, we were all challenged to keep a weekly blog. This is 
                    something I really enjoyed -- and that I kept at for a few months after the bootcamp (monthly 
                    posts until May 2020). I made one more post in May of 2021 and have not posted since.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a few topics I have been writing about (mostly reviews/summarys of technical books), and 
                    I thought I would start the blog back up. When thinking about posting again, I looked at some 
                    old posts and realized that I missed the personal side of blogging -- sharing small updates 
                    about what has been going on in my life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To get the blog back up, I have to do a few things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some general mainence and updates to the website</li>
                        <li>Writing a few blog posts:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A post saying that I will be posting again (this post!)</li>
                            <li>Year in Review posts for 2020, 2021, 2022, and a short post of what has been going on so far in 2023</li>
                            <li>A post talking about my "read more technical books" goal</li>
                            <li>Adding a few already written reviews/summaries of technical books as posts to this blog</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            Create a utility script that will parse a text file (blog post) into some html: <a>link</a>. 
                            I used to write the blog post and then manually format them into html. I am hoping to streamline 
                            my blog writing a little bit by writing this utility program
                        </li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm exciting to be posting on this site again! Check out my year in review below:
