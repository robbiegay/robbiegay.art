                        Happy super ~spooky~ Friday the 13th!! This week was our final
                        week of Bootcamp Prework and it really seemed like these last four
                        weeks just flew by!

                        I was a little nervous going into the Prework phase. I wasn’t
                        really sure what to expect: Would the workload or complexity of
                        the material be too much to handle? Would I realize, once I had
                        become more immersed in coding, that it wasn’t really for me?
                        Thankfully I found neither of these to be the case — The course
                        material during Prework was challenging but exciting, and I’ve had a
                        lot more fun than I excepted to writing code!

                        This week was lighter on the readings, and started to skew more
                        towards project-based work. We started with another{' '}

                        introducing us to some more JavaScript building blocks — things
                        like loops, functions, return values, and events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we moved on to four coding projects. Our first project still
                        involved a little bit of handholding. For the{' '}

                        we were given some starter code, as well as instructions on what
                        parts of the code we still needed to fill in. After the Image
                        Gallery project, however, we were on our own.

                    <p>
                        My biggest takeaway from this week's assignments has been that I
                        have become a pretty big Pseudo Code enthusiast! For the{' '}

                            Timer</a>{' '}
                        assignment, I felt
                        like I had an idea of how the code could work pretty early on. I
                        <em>did</em> jot down a rough outline of the code, but didn’t
                        bother to mentally run through the various steps of my proposed
                        coding plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then jumped right into writing the code, and several hours later, I
                        was approaching something that resembled a Countdown Timer.
                        It was only when I was trying to work in some final bits of
                        functionality, that I realized that my initial approach was
                        fatally flawed. Had I used Pseudo Code to work through the logical
                        flow of my program <strong>before</strong> I started writing
                        code, then I likely would have realized some of these late-stage
                        mistakes early on. Instead, I ended up having to rewrite a lot of
                        my code, costing me several additional hours. Starting with Pseudo
                        Code would likely have saved me both time and headaches

                        us to Git, Github,
                        and Command Line. A lot of these new technologies felt very
                        confusing at first. After 4 weeks of (nearly) daily practice, I
                        think I am starting to feel more comfortable... at least with the
                        basics.

                        us to HTML and
                        CSS, and saw us creating our first blog posts! I found the
                        structuring of HTML to be fairly straightforward. Conversely, I
                        really struggled with getting CSS to work. It was challenging to
                        try to understand the various parent/child relationships between
                        the different elements, or to figure out how different properties got
                        inherited or overwritten. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect
                        though, was finally getting your webpage looking how you want
                        it to, only to realize that, if viewed on anything other than
                        a browser window of <strong>exactly the same size</strong>,
                        that things weren't going to look anything close to how you
                        laid them out.

                            3</a>{' '}
                        introduced
                        us to
                        JavaScript, while Week 4 added some more fundamentals
                        to our knowledge portfolio. Most of the challenges of working with
                        JavaScript involved coping with the various highs and lows of
                        creative problem solving. First came the high of the eureka moment when you
                        became <strong>convinced</strong> of a solution to your current
                        problem. Then, the low of this solution only managing to break
                        what you had working before. One thing that helped was to not
                        immediately wad your new idea up and throw it in the trash.
                        I found that many times, pausing to comb through your code for
                        syntax errors could be really helpful — as maybe your new solution
                        <em>might</em> actually work if you hadn’t misspelled a variable
                        or left out a bracket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that I found really helpful was occasionally closing
                        my computer. For one, just taking breaks and maybe mulling over a
                        problem while you took a walk could often leave to breakthroughs,
                        to thinking, "why hadn't I thought of that yet". And second, I
                        found that beginning your code with just pen and paper was a really helpful
                        way to start. By forcing myself to slow down, to work through ALL
                        the steps of the problem, and to chart out ALL the functionalities
                        I would need, would often lead to developing a better roadmap and
                        better code. I was then able, still with
                        pen and paper, to start solving these problems and adding
                        various functionalities. This made the act of writing the code
                        a little bit like filling in the blanks.

                        I felt like we learned a lot more than I expected to in this
                        introductory period, and I am really stoked to see what we
                        will be learning in our first few weeks of Bootcamp!
